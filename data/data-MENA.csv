Scrapbooks with clippings of newspaper articles; copies of propaganda leaflets directed to German soldiers and civilians during the war; reports, correspondence with family, and printed matter relating to war-time service; and photographs.",The finding aid is written in English,"The Russell Barnes papers span the years 1920-1978. The bulk of the material concerns the period 1941-1953, the years Barnes spent as foreign correspondent for the <title render=""italic"">Detroit News</title> and the three-year interval during which he served in the Office of War Information.

 The collection consists primarily of scrapbooks of his news stories, OWT leaflets, collected propaganda, and letters which he sent to his wife Constance, and, less frequently, to his children, Jeannot (Lucie Jeanne) and Jamie (John James Ingalls) while overseas and in New York. The most detailed description of his professional activities can be found in the letters he wrote during the months at the OWI in New York. He discusses the OWI personnel, its reorganization and the conflict with the OSS. The letters from the OWI Cairo and Algiers contain lively discussions of local customs and the rigors of life there, but are constrained by war-time censorship and thus shed less light than might be expected on his role as PWB director. The letters written while he covered the U.N. sometimes reflect the tense atmosphere there and the pressure brought to bear upon newsmen to take a stand on the issues they report. Barnes also discusses the power struggle in the Detroit Foreign Policy Association.","Russell Curtis Barnes was born in Huntington, Indiana on August 31, 1897, the son of James F. and Lucy A. (Stewart) Barnes. There he attended high school and worked for the <title render=""italic"">Huntington Press</title> before entering the University of Michigan. During his years at the University, Barnes was active in a variety of student activities including working for the <title render=""italic"">Michigan Daily</title>, the <title render=""italic"">Gargoyle</title>, and the <title render=""italic"">Wolverine</title> and writing the book and lyrics for two Michigan Union Opera productions. In addition, he acted as campus correspondent for the <title render=""italic"">Detroit News</title>. In 1920 he received his A.B. degree in economics.

 Immediately after graduation Barnes began full-time work at the <title render=""italic"">Detroit News</title>. During the years 1920-1925 he reported from the Detroit, Lansing and Washington news bureaus. In 1925 he was assigned to Paris as foreign correspondent. While there he met Constance Ingalls and they were married in 1927.

 Barnes returned to the U.S. in 1931, again assigned to cover stories in Detroit, Lansing and Washington. During this time he also became a radio commentator on Detroit News Station WWJ. In 1937 he organized the Detroit Committee on Foreign Relations and became its first secretary.

 Barnes was made London correspondent in 1941 and reported on the effects of the war there for the <title render=""italic"">Detroit News</title>, WWJ, and for the North American Newspaper Alliance. However, he was recalled for assignments in the U.S. before the end of the year.

 In 1942 Barnes received a leave of absence from the <title render=""italic"">Detroit News</title> to join the Office of War Information in New York. Here he compiled war news stories and made overseas broadcasts for the Voice Of America. By February of 1943 he was appointed Special Assistant to the American Minister to Egypt and General Representative of the Overseas Operations Branch of the OWI. In this capacity Barnes acted as one of the two press officers allowed to attend the Cairo and Teheran conferences of Allied leaders. In 1944 he became chief of the OWI, Mediterranean Theater and director of the Psychological Warfare Bureau, Allied Forces Headquarters. He commanded over 4,000 men in the preparation and dissemination of propaganda in preparation for the Allied invasion in August 1944. In addition, he was responsible for the overall distribution of news in print and on radio in Italy, North Africa and the Middle East. After his resignation from the post in 1945 he received the War Department's Exceptional Civilian Service Emblem.

 Rejoining the <title render=""italic"">Detroit News</title> as foreign correspondent, Barnes sent back stories from numerous foreign countries and covered the Paris Peace Conference and other meetings of national leaders before returning to New York as United Nations correspondent. In 1953 he returned to Detroit to become the newspaper's foreign news analyst until his retirement in 1970. During that time and since his retirement Barnes has been active as a lecturer on politics and foreign affairs at Oakland Community College and for a variety of community organizations.",6151; 5966; 5967; 6152; 6153; 5738; 3734; 3735; 3736; 3737; 6151; 3648; 3738; 3739; 5738,"Detroit news.; Journalists; American newspapers; Propaganda.; Psychological warfare.; World War, 1939-1945.; Banquets.; Children; Classrooms.; Clubhouses; Detroit news.; Fraternities and sororities.; Journalists; Reporters.; World War, 1939-1945.",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh,3471; 3142; 3140,Albums.; Photographs.; Scrapbooks.,gmgpc; aat; aat,1004; 893; 1005; 1006,Algiers (Algeria); Egypt.; Huntington (Ind.); Italy.,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,293; 293; 293; 5871; 5770,"Barnes, Russell Curtis, 1897-; Barnes, Russell Curtis, 1897-; Barnes, Russell Curtis, 1897-; Coughlin, Charles E.

2490,umich-bhl-86169,"George Robert Swain Photographs and Papers,circa 1870-1947 (bulk 1913-1947)","University of Michigan staff photographer, 1913-1947 and commercial photographer in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Collection includes some manuscript material but is primarily photographic prints and negatives made by Swain. Photo subjects include university buildings, faculty, and student activities, archeological expeditions to the Near East and, Ann Arbor scenes and landscapes from his travels in the western United States and Canada.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The papers and photographs of George R. Swain mainly document Swain's accomplishments as university photographer at the University of Michigan from 1913 to 1947. Researchers should note, however, that this is only a sampling of the photographer's work during these years. The Kelsey Museum of Archaeology at the University of Michigan has an extensive collection of Swain's archaeological negatives and prints, and researchers interested in his full career will want to also look at the Kelsey collection. The Bentley Library material, while including several folders of fine photographs Swain made on his travels with Professor Frances Kelsey, for the most part documents Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan.

 The collection at the Bentley Library consists of three series: Miscellaneous Papers; Photographers Log; and Photographs (prints; negatives; and lantern slides. Since the bulk of the collection is comprised of early twentieth century images of Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan, the materials will be of most interest to researchers searching for visual documentation of this part of the state in that time period. There are very few materials beyond the visual, although the lengthy captions attached to many overseas images and the essays, diaries, and letters, are extremely interesting and offer insight into how Swain approached his craft, both as a professional photographer and in his personal work.","George Robert Swain was born on July 15, 1866 in Meredith, New Hampshire. He died at the age of eighty on April 8, 1947, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. An educator and a photographer, his career included thirty-four years of service to the University of Michigan as university photographer from 1913 to 1947.

 After irregular primary school education in New Hampshire, Swain traveled to California, where he took and passed the teacher's examination in 1888. He taught first in ungraded country schools and then at a high school in Ventura, California, where one of his students was Edith Louise Rice, who would later become his wife.

 Swain received his B.A. degree from the University of Michigan in 1897 and his M.A. degree in 1900. The future Mrs. Swain also spent her last two years of college at Michigan. After receiving the B.A. degree, Swain accepted the position of principal at the Great Falls, Montana High School. Subsequent to the awarding of the M.A. degree, he took another position at a school for boys in Cleveland, Ohio. He did not remain in Cleveland long, however, because as he remarked in a newspaper article, the required dormitory living interfered with his marriage plans.

 The Swains settled in Ann Arbor after their marriage in 1900. A few months later, George was offered principalship at the East Side High School in Bay City, Michigan. He served in that capacity for ten years, from 1900-1910. This position led to a similar post at the Lockport Township High School in Lockport, Illinois, where the Swains lived from 1911 to 1912.

 In 1913 Swain returned once again to the University of Michigan and began his work on campus with Professor Francis W. Kelsey of the Latin Department. Having previously traveled 2000 miles in 1899 by bicycle through France, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, and Germany covering Caesar's battlefields with his camera, he was well suited to accompany Professor Kelsey on trips to Europe as a photographic technician. During the four trips they made, Swain photographed valuable manuscripts for the university collection. In addition, immediately after World War I, the two men spent a year traveling throughout Europe on diplomatic passports, offering Swain another opportunity to utilize his photographic talents.

 In 1924 and 1925 Swain was part of a university expedition which conducted excavations at Antioch in Pisidia. He and Professor Kelsey drove university cars from Brussels to Naples and three hundred miles across Asia Minor. Their travels also led to a photographic study of the Roman aqueducts. In 1925 and 1926 Swain traveled to Italy, Greece, Mount Athos, and Patmos. He worked with the Franco-American committee in Tunisia and Algeria and was permitted to photograph old manuscripts in eleven monasteries, eight of which were on Mount Athos. On one trip he is reported to have exposed some 1,200 heavy glass plates, all of which were brought back for developing. At one time or another Swain traveled the entire Mediterranean coastline, with the exception of Spain and Morocco.

 As university photographer, Swain was allocated an office in the old campus library, where he produced negatives for lantern slides that were used in conjunction with lectures. His work was constantly in demand, and he worked long hours to produce the slides, which were particularly valued by faculties of the fine arts and engineering. Negatives were not developed on campus, however, but in his home darkroom at 1103 Packard Avenue, since the use of chemicals was forbidden in the library building. Examples of George Swain's work can be found in many university, student, and other publications emanating from Ann Arbor during these years.

 In addition to commitments as university photographer, George and his wife Edith directed a summer camp for girls, Kamp Kairphree near Alpena, Michigan and later at Lake Charlevoix. Young women from across the country were reported to have attended the camp. Swain also conducted a private photographic business and pursued personal interests with his camera. When the family traveled, he took his camera along and when not traveling, he focused his lens on the campus and surrounding city and countryside. His landscapes, cityscapes, waterscapes, portraits and campus views are a rich historical resource -- all of a remarkable quality -- providing researchers with a unique visual record of the Ann Arbor area in the early twentieth century.",10390; 10391; 10392; 10393; 5390; 5391; 3548; 3549; 5392; 4177; 3551; 4973; 5903; 3532; 5892; 3752; 4985; 10394; 5393; 4093; 5693; 10395; 10396; 3799; 3759; 3805; 5394; 4183; 3902; 5729; 5895; 7045; 7044; 5694,"Archaeology; Archaeology; Archaeology; Photographers.; Archaeology; Archaeology; Buildings; Business enterprises; Camping; Carts and wagons.; Churches; Dams; Dormitories; Dwellings; Greek letter societies; Laboratories.; Military training.; Nature photography.; Parades and processions; Parks; Photographers; Photography of mountains.; Photography of water.; Railroads; Roads; Streets; Victory celebrations; War damage.; Winter.; Women; Women college students; World War, 1914-1918; World War, 1914-1918; World War, 1914-1918",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lctgm; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; local; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; local,3152; 3142,Diaries.; Photographs.,aat; aat,861; 1837; 861; 214; 210; 211; 606; 207; 347; 209; 1966; 1016; 2947; 956; 854; 2948; 855; 2949; 2950,"Ann Arbor (Mich.); Au Sable River (Mich.); Ann Arbor (Mich.); Ann Arbor (Mich.); Ann Arbor (Mich.); Ann Arbor (Mich.); Ann Arbor (Mich.); Ann Arbor (Mich.); Ann Arbor (Mich.); Ann Arbor (Mich.); Barton Dam (Ann Arbor, Mich.); Dexter (Mich.); Egypt; Ferry Field (University of Michigan); Huron River (Oakland County-Monroe County, Mich.); Island Park (Ann Arbor, Mich.); Liberty Street (Ann Arbor, Mich.); Middle East; Turkey",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,4540; 4540; 5712; 8875; 2538; 1586; 7609; 4540; 261; 7609,"Swain, George Robert, 1866-1947; Swain, George Robert, 1866-1947; Bishop, William Warner, 1871-1955; Cooley, Mortimer E.

He attended Wilberforce University and was licensed to preach in 1919 by his father. Admitted to the Michigan Conference in 1923, he built churches and served as pastor in LaPorte, Indiana, Benton Harbor, Michigan, and Flint, Michigan.

 In 1934, Baber became pastor of the Ebenezer A.M.E. Church in Detroit. Under his leadership, Ebenezer grew from 600 to 6000 members by 1944, making it the largest pastorate in the A.M.E. denomination.

 At the General Conference of 1944, Baber was made 63rd bishop of the church. After brief service in Baltimore and Arkansas, Baber was assigned to the Fourth Episcopal District, encompassing Michigan, Canada, Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa. Then in 1956, he was reassigned to the First District, which ran from Philadelphia through New England.

 Barber's final assignment was to the Second District in 1964. It included the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. Based in the nation's capital, Baber became vocal in national politics. He publicly called on A.M.E. ministers to back President Johnson's 1965 urban housing program. And in 1968, he was an active supporter of Hubert Humphrey.

 Baber has been president of both the A.M.E. Bishops Council and General Board. He also served on the board of Kittrell College and as A.M.E. delegate to the New Delhi conference of the World Council of Churches.

St. Aubin was one of the first to come to the camp after its liberation. There are also diaries which provide added background and detail of St. Aubin's varied career.","Wilfrid de St. Aubin was born in Chicago, Illinois on November 24, 1902. He was educated at Notre Dame University and the Chicago-Kent College of Law. During the depression, he worked for various relief agencies in Indiana and Washington DC.

 It was during World War II that St. Aubin first began his association with the American Red Cross. In September 1943, he was appointed field representative for the American Red Cross Civilian War Relief program in Italy, France and Germany. His responsibilities centered around the distribution of relief supplies to civilians, the evacuation of these civilians, and the establishment of hospitals in combat areas. During the later period of the war, St. Aubin supervised welfare programs at Buchenwald.

 In 1945, St. Aubin became director of the Red Cross Civilian Relief program in Austria where he was concerned with relief and rehabilitation and where he helped re-establish the Red Cross society of that country. In 1947, he moved on to Hungary where he performed similar functions. During this time, he also carried out Red Cross missions in Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.

 In 1948, St. Aubin was appointed Delegate of the League of Red Cross Societies to the Middle East. Here he surveyed and advised national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies in Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Greece, Egypt, and Ethiopia. During part of this time, St. Aubin was attached to the staff of Count Folke Bernadotte, United Nations Mediator for Palestine. He surveyed the humanitarian problems of the Palestinian conflict, and was a special consultant on the needs of the refugees.

 In 1949, St. Aubin became supervisor for International Agency Relations of the American National Red Cross. During the Korean War, he was on an advisory committee on the prisoner of war situation. In 1955, he was appointed executive director of the Washtenaw County chapter of the American Red Cross. He retired from this position in 1969.

 Beyond the Red Cross, St. Aubin was involved in a variety of charitable and public service organizations, notably the American Overseas Association, the National Council of Christians and Jews, the Washtenaw County Interfaith Council of Churches, and Spaulding for Children (an adoption agency).

The series in the collection are Correspondence; Newspaper career; Writings, speeches, etc.; Personal and miscellaneous; Photographs; and Printed Material.","Stanley Mitchell Swinton was born September 1, 1919 in Charlevoix, Michigan He began his journalism career by working as a reporter--before graduating to editor-in-chief-- for the <title render=""italic"">Broadcaster</title>, the newspaper for University High School in Ann Arbor. He wrote his first professional news story at the age of 15 and sold it for $1 to the <title render=""italic"">Detroit Free Press</title>. This first journalistic victory cemented his desire to become a journalist.

 The son of University of Michigan Engineering Mechanics Professor Roy Swinton, Stanley Swinton attended the University of Michigan and earned his B.A. in 1940. While a student, he held two jobs: one as city editor of the <title render=""italic"">Michigan Daily</title>, the other working for the <title render=""italic"">Detroit Free Press</title>. Swinton also wrote short stories and won the prestigious Hopwood award. On graduation day, he attended the ceremonies in the morning and began working as an editor for the Associated Press that very afternoon. At the onset of World War II, he took military leave and worked as a front-line combat correspondent in North Africa, Italy, and southern France, writing for the <title render=""italic"">Stars and Stripes</title>, a newspaper published for American GI's overseas. After the war, he continued his work as an AP correspondent. In 1947-1948, he was named chief of bureau for Southeast Asia and in 1948-1950 for the Middle East. In the 1950s he married the former Helen Rhodes Meek of Scarsdale, NY and together they raised three sons. Swinton continued his rise through the ranks of the Associated Press and was named vice president, assistant general manager and director of World Services in 1972.

 Swinton's career spans the years of intense conflict throughout the world and his papers provide insightful commentary on world events. He met and interviewed military rebels, presidents, religious leaders, prime ministers, sports and entertainment figures, and VIPs throughout the world. In 1950, he managed to get expelled from Egypt by King Farouk when he disclosed that Farouk planned to make the fiancée of a young Egyptian commoner his Queen against her will. Among his most famous stories is an eyewitness account of Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini hanging by his heels in a Milan square. In addition, he has interviewed Ho Chi-Minh, Ferdinand Marcos, the Shah of Iran, and Indira Gandhi.

1216,umich-bhl-851587,Horace H. Rackham and Mary A. Rackham Fund Records,"The last will and testament of Horace H. Rackham provided for the establishment of a trust fund to provide for the health and welfare of individuals, particularly the sick, aged, the young, the poor, and other underprivileged. Much of the trust money went to the University of Michigan to be used for a building for the graduate school and an endowment to be used for different kinds of research. The Fund also awarded grants to agencies involved in child welfare, community culture, education, health, philanthropy, and science. The Fund distributed money from 1934 until about 1941. The series in this record group consist of administrative and executive files, and project applications and grant files.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The records of the Horace H. Rackham and Mary A. Rackham Fund document the continuing generosity of Horace Rackham and Mary Rackham to numerous charitable, educational, and scientific organizations and causes. The records contain the files of the Fund's trustees and directors and provide insight and information about such topics as the administration of a philanthropic fund-giving organization during the mid-1930s, the kinds of gifts made, the relationship among the Fund's trustees and officers, and the relationship between the Fund and the grant recipients. Because of the size of the gift, most of the documentation within the record group details the close ties between the Fund and the University of Michigan. These files concern not only the establishment of the Rackham endowment to the University, but also the different scientific and educational grants made. Additionally, these files detail the construction of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies building in Ann Arbor and the Rackham Educational Memorial building in Detroit.

 The records of the Fund cover the period of 1929-1950 though they bulk largest for the period of the Fund's greatest activity, 1934-1940. The record group has been separated into two series: Combined Administrative and Executive Office Files and Project applications/grants.","The Horace H. Rackham and Mary A. Rackham Fund was the agency created in 1934 to administer the terms of the trust created by the last will and testament of Horace H. Rackham. Under Article II of the articles of incorporation, the Fund was to ""effectually carry out and administer the benevolent, charitable, educational, and scientific trust created by Horace H. Rackham to promote the health, welfare, happiness, education, training, and development of men, women and children, particularly the sick, aged, young, erring, poor, crippled, helpless, handicapped, unfortunate and under-privileged, regardless of race, in the world ....""

 Accordingly, the trustees of the Fund, working conscientiously over the next six years to fulfill the terms of the trust, funded an extraordinary number of projects that they believed Rackham himself would have supported. In practice, their support divides into three areas: charity and benevolence, education, and science.

 The estate which the Fund was to administer was estimated at around 10 million dollars. The trustees and officers of the Fund were Mrs. Mary A. Rackham (honorary president), Bryson D. Horton (chairman and treasurer), Arthur J. Lacy (president), Mrs. Myra H. Bussey (vice-president), Clarence E. Wilcox (secretary), and Dr. Mark S. Knapp (director). Lacy's term as president was cut short when he decided to become a candidate for governor in 1935. Mrs. Rackham was anxious about the publicity that might accrue to the Fund because of Lacy's candidacy and requested his resignation. He was succeeded as president by Frederick Rolland.

 The work of investigating potential areas and recipients of support and distributing money was handled out of an Ann Arbor office which the Fund referred to as the executive office. All programs of course had to be approved by the five trustees. The director's office was originally located in the Nickels Arcade, but later moved in 1936 to a room in Angell Hall, a building at the University of Michigan, and then to the Rackham Building following its completion. Within the executive office, the Fund's director administered daily operations, undertook investigations of prospective recipients, and communicated back to the Fund's trustees. The fund's first director, Dr. Mark Knapp, resigned in 1936 and was succeeded by Mrs. Mary Clark. Knapp's area of specialty was medical research. His successor, Clark was a tireless worker who seemed to have a close relationship to Mrs. Rackham based upon the frequency of their correspondence.

 The administrative offices of the Fund were located in Detroit in the Dime Bank Building. Here Bryson D. Horton who had assumed the office of Fund secretary dealt with financial problems pertaining to the administration of the Rackham estate, probate matters, and related issues. The Rackham estate was large and complicated and Horton was continually dealing with matters of bonds, property, and other investments. The Fund secretary also counseled the Ann Arbor office on problems relating to the distribution of funds.

 There were many recipients of the Rackham estate but without question the biggest beneficiary was the University of Michigan. During his lifetime, Horace H. Rackham was a generous donor to the university. With his passing, President Ruthven and other university officials opened negotiations with the trustees of the Rackham Fund arguing that a major gift to the university would fulfill Horace Rackham's wish that his wealth be used for research and educational purposes. President Ruthven proposed a gift of $5 million dollars to be used for the building and endowment of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies. In 1935, the trustees agreed to the proposal, and in fact added 1.5 million to the 1 million originally suggested for the construction of the Rackham Building. In the next five years, the Fund or Mary Rackham personally donated funding for different university projects, principally a 1 million dollar gift in 1936 from Mary Rackham to establish the Institute for Human Adjustment and another million in 1937 from the Fund to establish the Rackham Arthritis Research Fund. In all from 1935 to 1936, the Rackham Fund and Mary Rackham personally gave nearly $12 million dollars to the University of Michigan.

 Beyond the gifts to the university, the Fund also awarded grants to numerous other worthwhile agencies. For purposes of analysis, these gifts divide into six groups: child welfare, community culture, education, health, philanthropy, and science. The following is a list of specific organizations (including University of Michigan).",8388; 8389; 6425; 6836; 6558; 6130; 6842; 5963; 4369; 4427; 4497; 8390,Aged; Archaeological expeditions; Birth control.; Child welfare; Depressions; Indians of North America; Philanthropists; Afro-Americans; Camps; Children playing.; Fountains; Fountains,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh,3142; 3140,Photographs.; Scrapbooks.,aat; aat,861; 2055; 2056; 934; 1025; 894; 2057; 2058; 1163; 1860; 1207; 1209; 1628; 1002; 2055; 2056; 2058; 1025,"Ann Arbor (Mich.); Bay Cliff Health Camp.; Boytown Camp (Washtenaw County, Mich.); Detroit (Mich.); Fenton (Mich.); Flint (Mich.); Flushing (Mich.); Franklin Settlement Summer Camp (Lake Orion, Mich.); Mason (Mich.); Oakland County (Mich.); Pontiac (Mich.); Port Huron (Mich.); Shady Trails Camp (Northport, Mich.); Ypsilanti (Mich.); Bay Cliff Health Camp.; Boytown Camp (Washtenaw County, Mich.); Franklin Settlement Summer Camp (Lake Orion, Mich.); Fenton (Mich.)",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,6561; 502; 1616; 2060; 2392; 6122; 31,"Clark, Mary H.; Horton, Bryson Dexter, 1871-1945; Knapp, Mark Stevens, 1872-1948; Novy, Frederick George, 1864-1957; Rackham, Horace H., 1858-1933; Rackham, Mary A.

The collection has been arranged into seven series: Biographical/personal; Correspondence; Diaries; Lectures, Essays, Speeches, Publications; Archaeological Expeditions; Organizational Affiliations; and Miscellaneous.","Leroy Waterman, a distinguished Bible scholar, translator and archaeologist, and an author of several books and many articles based on his archaeological and linguistic research, was a professor of Semitics at the University of Michigan from 1915 to 1945. He was born in Pierpont, Ohio, July 4, 1875, the son of Hadley Alpha and Louisa (Lombard) Waterman. He received his preliminary education at public schools in Pierpont, and at New Lyme Institute, New Lyme, Ohio. He graduated from Hillsdale College with a B.A. in 1898 and B.D. in 1900. He then studied at Oxford University (1900-02), the University of Berlin in (1906-07), and the University of Chicago where he received his Ph.D. degree in 1912.

 During this same period of training, Waterman also taught, as a professor of Hebrew language and literature at the Divinity School of Hillsdale College from 1902 to 1910 and as a Fellow at the University of Chicago from 1910 to 1912. After receiving his doctorate, Waterman became a professor of the Old Testament and the history of religion at Meadville (Pa.) Theological School in 1913, and two years later joined the University of Michigan as head of the Department of Semitics, which later became the Department of Oriental Languages and Literatures. He remained at the U-M until his retirement as professor emeritus in 1945.

 A distinguished Biblical scholar, Waterman, during the years 1922-27, was one of five members of the translation committee of the University of Chicago, whose work resulted in The Bible: An American Translation, sometimes called the Chicago Bible; and during 1938-52 he was a member of a committee of 31 scholars appointed by the National Council of Churches of Christ in America, which produced the Revised Standard Version of the Bible in 1952.

 He served as the annual professor at the American School of Oriental Research, Baghdad, Iraq in 1928-29, and was director of the Mesopotamian archaeological expedition at Tel-Umar, twenty-five miles south of Baghdad near the Tigris river, sponsored by the University of Michigan, the Toledo (Ohio) Museum of Art, and the Cleveland (Ohio) Art Museum from 1928 to 1931. Waterman began the excavation of the ancient city of Seleucia, having located the site through his study of ancient writings and the use of aerial photos of an area of mounds in the desert. As director of the expedition for the first five seasons he established the site of the city, its general plan and architecture, and learned a great many new facts about the life of the times. Selucia, a city of 600,000 inhabitants, was the greatest city outside of Greece except for Alexandria. It was founded by Seleucus, a general of Alexander the Great. Some Parthian objects were discovered first, evidences of a later civilization, a mixture of Persian and Greek. Then a portion of a palace was excavated, and some very beautiful jewelry was found as well as pottery, coins, figurines, seals and other artifacts. Many bricks with the stamp of Nebuchadnezzar were found in the area. The results of the five seasons' work were published in the <title render=""italic"">Preliminary Report Upon the Excavations at Tel Umar, Iraq</title> (University of Michigan Press 1931) and the Second Preliminary Report (1933).

 Waterman was also director of an archaeological expedition at Sepphoris, Galilee, near Nazareth during the summer of 1931 sponsored by the University of Michigan. Remains of a Roman theatre and an early Christian church were found, together with an aqueduct tunnel, pottery, coins, and numerous household objects of bone, and bronze, gold and iron jewelry. One objective of this project was to find materials that would enrich our knowledge of the life and times of Jesus. The results were published in the <title render=""italic"">Preliminary Report of the University of Michigan at Sepphoris, Palestine</title> (University, of Michigan Press, 1931).

 In addition, Waterman also lectured for the University of Michigan Extension Service in Detroit, Grand Rapids, and Ann Arbor during the period of 1945-65, and was a teacher of Bible courses at the First Baptist and the First Methodist churches in Ann Arbor during 1961-71.

 His scholarly works included editing volume XIV of R.F. Harper's <title render=""italic"">Assyrian and Babylonian Letters</title> (1912), and translating <title render=""italic"">Some Koujunjik Letters and Related Texts</title> (1912), and <title render=""italic"">Business Documents of the Hammurabi Period</title> (1916) and <title render=""italic"">The Royal Correspondence of the Assyrian Empire</title>, consisting of four volumes (1930).

 Professor Waterman's particular interest was in the Old Testament and its extension into the New. His studies and research in this field together with his intense interest in current events led to the publication of the following books: <title render=""italic"">Religion Faces the World Crisis</title> (1943), <title render=""italic"">The Religion of Jesus</title> (1952), <title render=""italic"">The Historical Jesus: Hope of Mankind</title> (1955), <title render=""italic"">Forerunners of Jesus</title> (1959), <title render=""italic"">Religion's Role in Tomorrow's World</title> (1963), and <title render=""italic"">The Christian Objective</title> (1969). He also published a translation and interpretation of the <title render=""italic"">Song of Songs</title> (1948) and contributed numerous articles to various religious and scholarly journals.

 Professor Waterman received an honorary D. Litt. degree from Hillsdale College in 1925 and an Honorary D.D. degree from Butler University in 1961. He was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science; the American Oriental Society, 1915 - Life member, annual president, 1936; National Association of Biblical Instructors, 1915; Royal Asiatic Society; Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis (president, 1946); Society for Old Testament Study; Research Club of the University of Michigan; the University Club of Ann Arbor; and the Michigan Council of Churches and Christian Education, (president, 1937-42).

 Leroy Waterman was married in Hillsdale, Michigan on July 24, 1906 to Mabelle Alice Walrath, daughter of Joseph Harvey and Lydia (Mount) Walrath of that city where her father was a Baptist minister. They had two children: Dorothea Lydia, who married George Ragland, Jr., and Donald Leroy (deceased 1931).

The papers are organized into the following series: Correspondence and related; Professional papers; Travel and personal; Photographs; and Astronomical observations calculations.","James Craig Watson (January 28, 1838-November 22, 1880) was a Canadian-American astronomer born in the village of Fingal, Ontario Canada. His family relocated to Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1850. In 1857, Watson graduated from the University of Michigan where he had studied the classics, mathematics, and the principles of theoretical and practical astronomy taught by professor Franz Brünnow. After graduation, Watson worked as Brünnow's assistant, and when his mentor resigned in 1859, Watson was made professor of astronomy in charge of the Observatory. Brünnow returned in 1860, resigned again in 1863, and at this time, Watson assumed the position as second director of Detroit Observatory serving until 1879.

 Watson contributed to various astronomical journals and was the author of <title render=""italic"">Popular Treatise on Comets</title> (1861) and <title render=""italic"">Theoretical Astronomy</title> (1868). Watson, in addition, made good use of the Observatory telescope. He was the discover of 22 asteroids, beginning with 79 Eurynome in 1863. One of his asteroid discoveries, 139 Juewa was made in Beijing when Watson was there to observe the 1874 transit of Venus.

 Watson was a strong believer in the existence of the planet Vulcan, a hypothetical planet closer to the Sun than Mercury, which is now known not to exist (however the existence of small Vulcanoid planetoids remains a possibility). He believed he had seen two such planets during a July 1878 solar eclipse in Wyoming.

 In 1879, Watson resigned his position at the University of Michigan to become director of the Washburn Observatory of the University of Wisconsin.

Scattered papers are also present and include biographical material and topical files relating to Johnston's personal, religious, and professional activities. The collection has been arranged into five series, which include: Personal and Family Photographs, Work Photographs, Camp Davis Photographs, Glass negatives, and Biographical Materials.","Clarence Thomas Johnston was born on a farm in Littleton, Colorado on October 23, 1872. His mother, Melissa Drummond Johnston, was of Scotch and Welsh ancestry. His father, James Albert Johnston, was of Scotch-Irish and Dutch ancestry. James Johnston pursued a variety of careers: he was a farmer, miner, railway and canal builder, superintendent of irrigation systems, administrative officer in Wyoming, and finally, a banker.

 C.T. Johnston married Bessie Vreeland of Cheyenne, Wyoming on October 20, 1897. It is perhaps telling of his dedication to his career that Johnston named his two sons, Clarence Nettleton and Franklin Davis, after engineers. Clarence bore as middle name the surname of E.S. Nettleton, James Johnston's partner in irrigation work, and Franklin was given the name of Professor Davis from the University of Michigan.

 C.T. Johnston was educated in country schools and attended high school in Cheyenne, Wyoming, 1885-1890. He received a B.S. in civil engineering from the University of Michigan in 1895, and did graduate work in absentia from the University of Michigan, 1897-1899, to receive a C.E. degree. Johnston spent the summers of 1892-1894 in field work under the State Engineer of Wyoming. His later specialty in irrigation, drainage, and riparian rights shows roots in the work from this time. In July 1893, he completed the surveys and plans for a reservoir for the Wyoming Development Company. The reservoir had a water line of 35 miles, and a 1 1/4 mile-long dam that was 35 feet high. Later in the summer of 1893, he surveyed a line over 100 miles long for a large canal from the North Platte River in eastern Wyoming.

 From fall 1894 to spring 1895, Johnston laid out placer ground over 9,000 acres for the West Side Mining Company in Routte County, Colorado. This project included maintenance of 30 miles of canal, installing a placer mining plant, and submitting a report for treating amalgam. Between 1896 and 1898, Johnston measured streams for the U.S. Geological Survey and worked in the office of the State Engineer. Early in the spring of 1897, he was involved in the construction of a large reservoir near Wheatland, Wyoming. The project involved tunnels, reinforced concrete design, and special hydraulic structures. In the fall of 1897, Johnston helped Capt. H.M. Chittenden in a study of reservoir sites in Colorado and Wyoming.

 Johnston was appointed Assistant State Engineer of Wyoming in November, 1897. He held that position until the spring of 1899, at which time he was appointed Assistant Chief of Irrigation Investigation for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This work included the study of drainage as well. Regionally, the work encompassed all western states and the South (in connection with rice cultivation). For a year in 1901 and 1902, Johnston pursued further study of irrigation and drainage in foreign countries. He studied Spain, Southern France, Northern Italy, Algiers, and particularly Egypt.

 In 1903, Johnston resigned from government service to accept the position of State Engineer of Wyoming. In that office, he had administrative charge of all water use within the borders of Wyoming. During the period of Johnston's tenure from 1903 to 1911, over 10,000 rights to use water were determined and plans were approved for many million dollars worth of construction. During this same period, Johnston had charge of municipal work and water power development in Wyoming and other states. The water system of Cheyenne was one of the large undertakings of this character where a series of reservoirs was built, two of the dams being approximately 100 feet high.

 On February 1, 1911, C.T. Johnston was appointed to a newly created professorship of Surveying and Geodesy in the School of Engineering at the University of Michigan. Until this time, surveying and geodesy was a part of the regular civil engineering curriculum. Under Johnston's direction, additional elective courses for the specialty in surveying were organized. A separate Department of Geodesy and Surveying was established and chaired by Johnston in 1921. Degrees were first granted from the department in 1922-1923, but the department was discontinued in 1941.

 Upon Johnston's arrival at Michigan in 1911, he assumed direction of the School of Engineering's summer surveying camp. The camp was located near Cheboygan in northern Michigan at Douglas Lake. It was known as Camp Davis after Professor Joseph B. Davis from the school. Other faculty with whom Johnston worked closely at the camp were Professor Howard B. Merrick (who had run the camp until Johnston's arrival) and Assoc. Professor Hugh Brodie.

 Johnston did much to rebuild Camp Davis over the years 1914-1920. However, a standing rivalry with the Biological Station at Douglas Lake prompted interest in relocating the surveying camp. Johnston led explorations of sites in Wyoming, and in 1929 the Regents of the University purchased 120 acres near Jackson Hole, 75 miles south of Yellowstone National Park. The Jackson site became the new Camp Davis. In 1941, C.T. Johnston retired from the School of Engineering.",6456; 3703; 3612; 4552; 4289; 6806; 4553; 4351; 4039; 4040,Engineers; Boats.; Camping.; Canals.; Dams.; Indians of North America.; Irrigation.; Photographers.; Surveying; Surveying,lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm,3485; 3508; 3142,Cyanotypes.; Glass photonegatives.; Photographs.,gmgpc; gmgpc; aat,2135; 1613; 1612; 893; 2136; 1681; 1614; 1651,Burt Lake (Mich.); Camp Davis (University of Michigan); Douglas Lake (Mich.); Egypt.; Grand Teton National Park (Wyo.); Idaho.; Wyoming.; Yellowstone National Park.,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,2458; 2458; 2458,"Johnston, Clarence Thomas, 1872-1970; Johnston, Clarence Thomas, 1872-1970; Johnston, Clarence Thomas, 1872-1970",lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf,520; 1565; 3615; 600; 3899; 4310; 1075; 4310,"First Congregational Church (Ann Arbor, Mich.); Michigan.

In his correspondence written while abroad, Kelsey frequently comments on the world scene with mention, for example, of political conditions in Turkey and the controversy surrounding the Lausanne Treaty.","Francis Willey Kelsey was born at Ogden, New York on May 23, 1858, and graduated from the University of Rochester in 1880. From that same institution, he also received his Ph.D. in 1886 and LL.D. in 1910. He began teaching Latin at Lake Forest University in 1880 and continued there until 1889 when he came to the University of Michigan. In 1890, upon the death of Henry S. Frieze, Kelsey was made head of the Latin Department and here he gained renown as a teacher, a translator of classical texts, and an advocate of classical studies.

 Kelsey's reputation as a scholar was international. In 1900-1901, he was given a leave of absence to serve as director of the American School of Classical Studies in Rome. Later in 1920, Kelsey organized and secured funds for the first Near East Expedition of the University of Michigan, which he directed for the next two years. As a result, a wealth of photographs, archaeological material, especially manuscripts and papyri, were brought to the University Library. In 1924, he arranged a second expedition which resulted in successful excavations at ancient Antioch, Carthage, and Karanis in the Fayoum of Egypt.

 Kelsey was active in the University Musical Society serving as its president from 1889 until his death in 1927. From 1907 to 1912, he was president of the Archaeological Institute of America. He also was a member of other classical associations and served as president of the American Philological Association in 1907 and the Michigan Schoolmasters' Club in 1927. He died May 14, 1927.

 Kelsey married Mary Isabelle Badger in 1886.

 The Francis W. Kelsey Museum of Archaeology was founded in 1928 to house, care for, and exhibit the university's growing collection of ancient artifacts acquired through purchase, gift or as the result of archaeological excavations by university faculty.

 Francis W. Kelsey, Professor of Latin Language and Literature, 1889-1927, began the university's archaeological apart of his extensive travels and research in the Mediterranean, Near East and North Africa. In 1924 Kelsey organized the first of a series of excavation in Egypt and Iraq under the auspices of the Institute for Archaeological Research with funding provided by Horace Rackham.

 Professor Arthur E.R. Boak directed the initial excavations at Karanis, Egypt, which continued through 1935 under the Professor Enoch E. Peterson. Major excavations were also conducted at Dimé and Terenouthis. Kelsey chose Professor David Robinson of Johns Hopkins University to lead the Asia Minor expedition. The Michigan team initially assistance William Ramsey excavation of the site of Roman Antioch at Pisidia. Robinson later received permission form the Turkish authorities to begin excavations at Sizma, near Konia. The core of the Museum's collection derives from these excavations.

 After Kelsey's death in 1927 a Museum of Classical Archaeology was established as part of the University Museums, with Professor John G. Winter of the Department of Latin and Greek as director and Dr. Orma Fitch Butler as curator. In 1940 the museum became a separate reassert unit of the University under the title Museum of Art and Archaeology. as renamed the Museum of Archaeology when the Art Museum was made a separate entity. The Board of Regents recognized Kelsey's pioneering work by renaming the museum the Francis W. Kelsey Museum of Archaeology in 1953.

 From its founding, the Kelsey Museum has been located in the former Student Christian Association building on State Street.

 The Kelsey Museum now houses a collection of nearly 100,000 objects from the civilizations of the Mediterranean. A selection of these artifacts are featured in two permanent galleries: Egypt and the Ancient Near East, and Greece, Etruria, Rome, 5000 BC - AD 900, as well as in a gallery with annual changing exhibitions. The museum also sponsors research, educational programs for children, oversees fieldwork projects, and serves as the home for the Interdepartmental Program in Classical Art and Archaeology.",6667; 8714; 8715; 8716,Archaeology.; Excavations (Archaeology); Excavations (Archaeology); Excavations (Archaeology),lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,3142; 3143,Photographs.; Maps.,aat; aat,2154; 2155,Karanis (Egypt); Carthage (Extinct city),lcsh; lcsh,9007; 58; 8355; 2810; 442; 2114; 5220; 5839; 1884,"Boak, Arthur Edward Romilly, 1888-1962; Bonner, Campbell, 1876-; Butler, Orma Fitch.; Jerome, Thomas Spencer, 1864-1914; Kelsey, Francis W.

Forsyth (1901-1991) was an archeologist, architectural, and art historian who led archeological expeditions to Angers, France, Mount Sinai, Egypt, and countries in the Near East including Iraq, Syria, and Turkey. Forsyth was a professor at the University of Michigan, chairman of the History of Art Department and director of the Kelsey Museum. The collection is comprised of personal materials, teaching materials, and extensive documentation of George's personal travel and archeological expeditions to Europe and the Near East such as correspondence, field notes, and visual materials.",The finding aid is written in English,"The George H. Forsyth papers primarily document Forsyth's career. The collection includes personal materials, biographical information, daybooks, family photographs, teaching and lecture notes, and extensive documentation of George's personal travel and archeological expeditions to Europe and the Near East. Material related to expeditions includes field notebooks, photographs, negatives, architectural drawings, correspondence, and manuscripts of various publication activities.

George Forsyth died prior to completing the publication of his landmark drawings of Saint Catherine’s Monastery (Mount Sinai, Egypt). Publication efforts were continued posthumously by his wife, Dr. Ilene H. Forsyth, an art historian and professor at the University of Michigan. 

Researchers should note that a scrapbook in this collection contains visual material with racist content; specific information is included at the item level.","George Howard Forsyth was born September 2, 1901 in Chicago, Illinois to Sarah Brockunier and George H. Forsyth. He attended the Chicago Latin School, Lawrenceville School, and Princeton University graduating in 1923 with Bachelor of Arts and 1927 with a Master of Fine Arts. In the 1920s, Forsyth traveled widely in Europe and Near East corresponding with friend and noted art historian, Albert M. Friend. He documented his experience in personal writings, sketches, and photography. Forsyth returned to Princeton to finish his graduate degree and teach in the Department of Art and Archeology from 1927 to 1942. During his tenure at Princeton, Forsyth conducted a number of archeological expeditions to the Church of St. Martin in Angers, France, between 1926 and 1936, resulting in a published study in 1953. 

Forsyth served three years in the United States Navy, 1942-1945, as a lieutenant during World War II. Following his service, Forsyth accepted a visiting professorship at the University of Michigan and became chair of the Art History Department in 1947, a position he held until 1961. Also during his time at UM, Forsyth served as director of the Kelsey Museum, 1961-1969, and professor of archeology, 1969-1972. 

In 1954 and 1956, Forsyth led exploratory expeditions in search of a location to conduct a long-term archeological project. After exploring numerous churches, mosques, and other sites from antiquity in countries including Egypt, Greece, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey, Forsyth and his team settled on Saint Catherine's Monastery, in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, built in the sixth century by Byzantine Emperor Justinian. The succeeding expeditions were led by George Forsyth in conjunction with Kurt Weitzmann of Princeton University in four campaigns: 1958, 1960, 1963, and 1965. Many scholars and experts were involved in the archeological field work and documentation of the monastery’s religious icons and art. Experts included Fred Anderegg, University of Michigan photographer, Aziz Suryal Atiya of the University of Utah, Ernest Hawkins of the Byzantine Institute, among many others. Several publications resulted from the Michigan-Princeton-Alexandria expeditions, but at the time of his death, Forsyth had not published the landmark measured drawings he made based on precise field notes and detailed survey methods of the Monastery St. Catherine. Publication activities and a catalog of the drawings were compiled by Ilene Forsyth, George's wife, and Lois Drewer, of Princeton University, in multiple iterations in the 1990s. Dr. Ilene H. Forsyth was an art historian of medieval art and architecture.

The Papers have been divided into four series: Biographical and Miscellaneous Material, Correspondence, Journals, and Photographs and Slides.","Rup Chand was associated with the University of Michigan for over forty years as a collector and labeler of plant and bird specimens from India, Persia, Afghanistan, Tibet and other parts of the Middle East and South Asia. Born April 16, 1902 in the Lahul district of the Punjab province of India, he was the son of Thakur Jai Chand and Thakur Kalzang Dolma. The Thakur family was a prominent family in Lahul; an ancestor had been given the status of chief of Ko-lon, a position that has been passed on to the oldest son of the family for generations.

 In 1927 Chand joined the Indian Territorial Army Force, where he served with several family members. In the Summer of 1930, after leaving the army, Chand met University of Michigan professor Walter Koelz, who was collecting plant specimens for the Himalayan Research Institute of the Roerich Museum. Chand soon joined Koelz in his collection efforts. Chand and Koelz worked and traveled together for nearly thirty years. Chand himself collected more than 8000 specimen from places such as Assam, India, Persia, Nepal, Tibet and Afghanistan.

 Chand visited the United States with Koelz in 1934 and 1937. In Michigan he met Professor Harley Bartlett, who extended a series of University appointments in order to help support Chand's plant collecting. When Koelz returned to Michigan in 1953, Bartlett helped to secure permission for Chand to immigrate to the United States in 1956. Chand lived with Koelz at his home in Waterloo, Michigan until the two had a falling out in 1960. Chand filed a $50,000 lawsuit against Koelz, which he claimed was his share of the profits from the pair's collecting efforts. Chand won the case in 1964 and was awarded over $15,000.

 Chand worked independently on extensive labeling projects for the Koelz and Rup Chand collections until 1960, when a National Science Foundation Grant allowed the University Herbarium to hire Rup Chand as a full-time plant mounter. Chand often worked closely with Dr. Ralph Stewart, an expert on the flora of the Himalayas and Northern India. Chand officially retired from the University in 1970, but continued to work on a part-time basis. He also worked on translating the diaries of his travels with Koelz from Udru into English.

She founded Radio Tahrir, which broadcasted regularly from circa 1990-2013 over New York City’s WBAI Radio. Radio Tahrir was the first radio program in the United States to focus on a wide range of topics pertaining to different Arab and Muslim communities across the world. 

The materials in this collection are dated from 1988-2014 and include broadcast episodes and episode segments as well as commentaries, documentaries, interviews, news reports, and literary recitations.",The finding aid is written in English,"The Barbara Aziz broadcasts collection (868 digital audio files (online) and 0.1 linear feet) document Dr. Barbara Nimri Aziz’s journalistic career, particularly as it pertained to WBAI Radio’s Radio Tahrir, Behind the News, and TalkBack programs. Collection material is dated from 1988-2014 and includes broadcast episodes and episode segments, commentaries, documentaries, interviews, news reports, and recitations. 

There is some overlap between the Radio Tahrir and related material series as well as the Interviews and related material series. Researchers are encouraged to consult both series for relevant material.","Barbara Nimri Aziz was born in Ontario, Canada, in 1940. In 1962, she graduated from Queens University in Kingston, Ontario, with a Bachelor in Arts degree in Biology. Aziz then traveled to India and spent several years assisting Tibetan refugees fleeing Chinese control of Tibet. This work inspired her interest in anthropology. In 1969, she enrolled at the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS). She received a Ph.D. in Anthropology from the SOAS in 1974. Her thesis was entitled ""The people of Dingri: a socio-historical portrait of a district in S.W. Tibet.""

In circa March 1990, Dr. Aziz established the Radio Tahrir radio magazine, which broadcasted over New York City’s WBAI Radio, an affiliate of the Pacifica Radio Network. Radio Tahrir (Radio “Liberation”) was the first radio program in the United States dedicated to Arab culture and society. Originally, the program focused on uplifting the voices of members of different Arab communities from around the world. It expanded its coverage in circa 1993 to include the voices of Muslim Americans, during which the program was briefly known as ""Arab Voices, Crescent Rising"". 

Radio Tahrir ultimately sought to highlight Arab and Muslim community members’ lived experiences, accomplishments, and challenges, particularly as it related to Islamophobia and civil rights. Radio Tahrir typically aired every week on Tuesdays or Saturdays in 30 or 60 minute episodes. These episodes featured a variety of content, including interviews and discussions with invited guests. In addition to its regular programming, Radio Tahrir also produced documentaries; specials, particularly during the month of Ramadan; and series, such as ""Maqam: From Cordoba to Baghdad"" (circa 1997), ""6 Arab American Poets"" (1997), and ""Fen Mejnoon with Dean and Maysoon"" (2004-2006). The program broadcasted regularly until April 13, 2013.

Radio Tahrir was led by Dr. Aziz, who served as the program’s executive director. She also served as host, co-host, or producer. She was supported by dozens of Arab and Muslim volunteers and interns over the years, including Hassen Abdella, Jad Abumrad, Aisha Al-Adawiya, Mona Al-Dahry, Fatima Ashraf, Saadia Aslam, Anisa Bouzianne, Ibrahim Gonzalez, Dave Hall, Nazik Hibatfa, Hussein Ibish, Mahmoud Ibrahim, Mona Iskander, Tamara Issak, Ryme Katkhouda, Dean Obeidallah, Sarah Malaika, Nadja Middleton, Reem Nasr, Sally Sherif, and Maysoon Zayid. Dr. Aziz recruited these volunteers and interns because she viewed Radio Tahrir as a space where Arab and Muslim community members could voice their concerns as well as become more deeply engaged with the public sphere and radio journalism. Many Radio Tahrir volunteer producers were also Muslim women whose positionality offered unique opportunities to address issues like discrimination in mosques and Muslim children’s educational needs. 

In addition to her work at Radio Tahrir, Dr. Aziz supported WBAI Radio and the Pacifica Network in other ways. She traveled throughout the Middle East, interviewing and providing reports for use in their programs as well as Radio Tahrir. She also spent a significant amount of time in Iraq documenting the impact of the United Nations sanctions in that country in the years following the Invasion of Kuwait. She also hosted the WBAI Radio current affairs program Behind the News from 2000-2002, and participated in other WBAI and non-WBAI programs, including Labbrish, The Morning Show, and TalkBack.

As a result of her work at Radio Tahrir, Dr. Aziz founded the Radius of Arab American Writers Inc. (RAWI) in 1993. RAWI is a national literary and networking organization focused on supporting Arab American writers. She served as RAWI’s director until about 2005. Her other professional activities included spending a year (2007-2008) at Algeria’s University of Oran as a Fulbright Scholar as well as working and teaching in Syria (from 2009-2012).

Dr. Aziz has published numerous books over the years, including <title render=""italic"">Heir to a Silent Song: Two Rebel Women of Nepal</title> (2001), <title render=""italic""> Swimming up the Tigris: Real Life Encounters with Iraq</title> (2007), <title render=""italic"">Short Features for Radio: A Manual for Broadcast Journalists</title> (2011), and <title render=""italic"">Yogmaya &amp; Durga Devi: Rebel Women of Nepal</title> (2020).

There is also material relating to feminism, publishing and copyright, rare books, and staging Elizabethan plays. Noteworthy is the extensive and substantive correspondence with Guy Hamilton and Gerald Cullinan, which ranges over literature, scholarship, politics, and personalities in the U.S. and England.

 The G.B. Harrison collection is divided into the following series: Diaries; Correspondence; Religious Activities; Addresses and Lectures; Articles, Reviews, and Pamphlets; and Manuscripts of writings.","Professor George Bagshawe Harrison was born in Hove, Sussex, England, on July 14, 1894. His education at Queens' College, Cambridge, was interrupted by the first world war, during which he served in India and Mesopotamia. In 1919 he returned to Cambridge, where he took a first class degree in English literature in 1920, one of the first such awarded.

 Harrison became reader in English literature at King's College, London, in 1924, and remained there until the start of the second world war, when he rejoined the army. In 1943 he was released from the army to take up the post of Head of the Department of English at Queen's University, Ontario. In 1949 he went to the University of Michigan, and in 1963-64 he was a member of the English faculty at the University of Windsor, in Windsor, Ontario. His publications include, besides his editions of the plays, a guide, the Companion to Shakespeare Studies (with Harley Granville-Barker), books on John Bunyan and the Earl of Essex, and the remarkable fictional Elizabethan and Jacobean journals. After his retirement, Harrison served on the International Commission on English in the Liturgy, for the Roman Catholic Church, for which he was instrumental in translating the Latin Mass into English.

 Professor Harrison, Shakespeare scholar, editor, and teacher, died in New Zealand on November 1, 1991, at the age of 97. Professor Harrison not only taught many hundreds of students of English literature during his forty years of service at universities in Britain, Canada, and the United States, but he was known to tens of thousands more from his text of Shakespeare's Complete Works, widely used in university courses since its publication in 1952.

In 1955 his family moved to Detroit, Michigan, home to a large Arab American community. He earned his bachelor's degree in anthropology and sociology from Wayne State University in 1972 and his master's and doctorate degrees in anthropology from the University of Michigan in 1973 and 1978, respectively.

 In the years following completion of his doctoral program, Abraham engaged in a variety of positions. These included teaching at the University of Algiers, directing projects focused on outreach and services in the Arab community and the development of curriculum materials and teacher training on Arabic culture and history and Arab American heritage, and serving as executive director of the Association of Arab-American University Graduates (AAUG) and consultant to the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC).

 After working as a visiting lecturer at the University of Michigan in 1984, Abraham was hired as an anthropology instructor at Henry Ford Community College (HFCC) in Dearborn in 1985. His courses included Introduction to Anthropology, Ethnology of North America, and Peoples and Cultures of the Middle East and North Africa. In 1996, he became director of HFCC's Honors Program and proceeded to redesign the program and its curriculum.

His brother is Sander Levin, U.S. Representative for Michigan's  9th district. Carl Levin attended Detroit public schools, graduating from Central High School in 1952. He worked briefly as a line worker at a Ford tractor factory when he was 19 years old and went on to attend Swarthmore College. As a student, Levin was actively involved in student groups including serving on the student council, the American Student Government Movement, and Students for Democratic Action (SDA). In 1956, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in political science and went on to attend Harvard Law School. Levin continued his student activism with SDA at Harvard and graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1959. Upon graduation, Levin returned to Michigan and worked as an attorney at Grossman, Human and Gossman from 1959 to 1964, and taught law at the University of Detroit Mercy and Wayne State University.

In 1961, Carl Levin married Barbara Halpern, who holds a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from the University of Michigan, a Master of Arts in mathematics from Colombia University, and a Bachelor of Laws from Wayne State University (1977). The Levins have three daughters -- Kate, Laura, and Erica.


Carl Levin left private law practice in 1964 to serve as general counsel for the Michigan Civil Rights Commission until 1967. He also served as special assistant attorney general for the state of Michigan and chief appellate defender for the city of Detroit (1968-1969). Levin began his political career in 1969 when he was elected to the Detroit Common Council, now the Detroit City Council (DCC). He served two four-year terms on the Council, including as President (1974-1977). During his tenure on DCC, Levin focused on issues such as discriminatory housing, lending, insurance practices, and redlining.

In 1978, Carl Levin, a member of the Democratic Party, was elected to the U.S. Senate, defeating 13-year Republican incumbent Robert P. Griffin. During his tenure in the Senate, Levin served in many leadership roles including chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, co-chair of the Senate Auto Caucus, co-chair of the Great Lakes Task Force, and co-founder and chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management. Among Senator Levin’s legislative accomplishments were the Enron investigations, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, financial regulation, campaign finance reform, environmental protections including helping to establish Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Keweenaw National Historical Park, early opposition to the Iraq War of 2003, government ethics and lobbying reform, and appropriations for the U.S. Military. Levin authored many bills, was noted for his in-depth research and preparation for committee hearings, and traveled abroad extensively as chair of the Armed Services Committee.

After 36 years of service, Carl Levin retired from the Senate on January 3, 2015 as Michigan's longest serving U.S. Senator. Upon retirement, Levin established the Levin Center at Wayne State University Law School, where he served as chair and distinguished legislator in residence.

Administrative files, topical files, and regional and national office materials; contain files relating to their interest in pacifism, draft counseling, community service, prison reform and other issues relating to the criminal justice system, and peace education (especially relating to the Middle East and the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians), and lesbian/gay issues.",The finding aid is written in English,The records of the Michigan Area Office of the American Friends Service Committee have been arranged into the followings series: Executive Committee / Coordinating Committee; Peace Education Committee; Community Relations Committee; National and Regional Offices; Administrative files; Topical files; and Audio-Visual Materials.,"The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) was established in 1917 during World War I as an outreach program of the Quakers, offering humanitarian aid to the war's victims. From the beginning, there has been a strong vein of dissent in Quaker outreach activities, protesting against abuse while caring for those who suffer.

 In 1960, the Michigan Area Office (MAO) of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) came into being in response to a concern from Friends in Michigan to expand AFSC programs beyond the volunteer youth service activities which had been going on in the 1950s. From the outset, the MAO sought to serve as many Michigan communities as possible through its peace education and youth service programs and projects. In 1972, the Michigan Area Executive Committee (MAEC), in conjunction with staff, developed a plan to establish a Western Michigan Program Office, and in 1975 the MAEC founded the Detroit Program Office.

 As of the 1970-1971 fiscal year, the MAO was made up of an executive committee, community relations committee, and peace education committee. The executive committee was responsible for making major policy decisions and providing overall leadership and review for programs in Michigan. The community relations committee and the peace education committee provided leadership and oversight for the programs within their respective domains.

 While the basic structure remained the same, the Michigan Area Office did undergo a few organizational changes since that time. In 1977, a restructuring subcommittee of the MAO clarified the position of the MAEC and changed the Michigan Area Program Secretary's title to Michigan Area Executive Secretary. (It appears the Michigan Area Executive Committee was previously known as the Michigan Area Program Committee.) This subcommittee also stated that the program committees--peace education and community relations--were responsible for defining policy areas, developing programming methods, identifying resources needed, and presenting these to the MAEC. Besides the two program committees, the MAEC was supported by personnel and nominating committees.

 Apparently the Michigan Area Executive Committee went through another name change or restructuring, since a later organizational chart shows the MAO as headed by a committee called the Michigan Area Coordinating Committee (MACC). This chart, which appears to be from the mid-1980s, indicates that the MACC was supported by the same four subordinate committees mentioned previously in relation to the MAEC.

 Although the Michigan Area Office was originally subordinate to the Dayton Regional Office (DRO), the DRO and the Midwest Regional Office merged in 1985 to create the Great Lakes Regional Office. An organizational chart shows that Dayton became the seat of an area office, which, with the MAO and the Chicago Area Office, was subordinate to the new Great Lakes Regional Office. The national office, which oversees nine regional offices, is based in Philadelphia.

 According to a 1986 statement, the mission of the American Friends Service Committee is ""to help express the historic Peace Testimony of Friends and Friends' commitments to equality, simplicity, peace and justice. These are founded in Friends' belief that every person possesses that of God within herself or himself, and is a person of worth and dignity."" The Michigan Area Office of the AFSC employed a small staff and relied on many volunteers to carry out its programs. The MAO Peace Education Committee (MAPEC) was especially active in Middle Eastern issues, and was led in this work by staff members Joe Volk and Richard Cleaver. Barbara Cartwright and Marc Mauer led the MAO Community Relations Committee (MACRC), which focused its work on increasing equity in the criminal justice system (especially regarding bail). In the 1990s, the organization began working on issues relating to discrimination against gays, lesbians, and bisexuals.",5807; 5808; 5809; 5810; 5811; 5812; 5813; 5814; 5815; 5816; 5817; 3601; 3602; 5818; 3603,"Bail; Criminal justice, Administration of; Jewish-Arab relations.; Draft.; Pacifism.; Peace; Prison reformers; Prisons; Prisons; African Americans; Church work.; Demonstrations; Pacifists; Quakers; Slums",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lctgm,3142,Photographs.,aat,216; 888,Ann Arbor (Mich.); Royal Oak (Mich. : Township),lctgm; lcsh,,,,1358; 1358; 4547; 3809; 1358,American Friends Service Committee.

Abdeen Jabara is concerned with issues of the civil rights of Arab Americans, the effects of the September 11th terrorist attack - nationally and globally - and the contentious relationship between Arab and Israeli organizations. The Jabara papers pertain to various litigation procedures and case files, including those in Michigan, with the federal government, and those involving various humanitarian projects. In particular, Jabara challenged the practice of law enforcement agencies to collect information and maintain surveillance of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) communities and Arab Americans. He was involved in a number of high-profile cases, for example, the murder trial of Sirhan Sirhan and the extradition case of Ziyād Abū ʻAyn (sometimes spelled Ziad Abu Ein or Ziad Abu Ain). Materials are organized into litigation and case files, as well as topical files pertaining to Arab American activism, organizational involvement, participation in the Middle East delegation of the National Lawyers Guild, and other pertinent global and national events highlighting Arabic issues.",The finding aid is written in English,"The collection has been divided into four series: Litigation/Court Cases, Political and Cultural Activities, Publications, and Topical Files. The materials primarily document the types of legal and political battles and causes that Jabara has tackled throughout his career. A limited amount of material in the collection is in Arabic and French, mostly correspondence, press clippings, and newsletters, and is noted where possible in the contents list.

Researchers should note that, because of the interconnected nature of Jabara's legal, political, and cultural work, topics and materials might be found in multiple series. "," Abdeen M. Jabara was born in Mancelona, Michigan in 1940 to Lebanese parents who had immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century. Jabara took an interest in Middle Eastern affairs throughout his youth and upon high school graduation (1958), he decided to attend the University of Michigan primarily because the school offered courses in Arabic and had a large Arab student population. During his early undergraduate years (1960s), Jabara determined that in order to learn the Arabic language properly, he would have to immerse himself in the culture. He spent five months in Cairo, then journeyed by freighter to Lebanon to visit his father's village.

 During Jabara's years of law school at Wayne State University in Detroit, he gradually became involved
with civil rights and founded a local chapter of the Civil Rights Research Council. He graduated from law school in 1965 and returned to Lebanon to further develop his Arabic language skills.

 Jabara returned to Detroit in 1966 to open his law practice. In 1967, the Arab-Israeli war and the anti-Arab sentiment it created prompted Jabara to become more involved with Arab-American issues. In 1968, Arab academics met at the University of Michigan to discuss the political situation and formed the Association of Arab-American University Graduates (AAUG). The mission of the AAUG was to promote educational and cultural activities and provide information about the Arab world and Arab-American community. Jabara served as the first executive secretary and was later elected president of the group in 1972.

 In 1970, Jabara joined the law firm of Lafferty, Reosti, Jabara, Papakhian, Stickgold, James, and Smith
in Detroit. For the next decade and a half, he would fight for the rights of Arabs living or traveling in
the United States, as well as for political activists in general. He did so by challenging the practice of
collecting information and maintaining surveillance of Arabs and Arab Americans by such institutions as the Detroit and Michigan State Police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Secretary of State. Jabara's own case against the FBI, for which he enlisted the help of the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU), finally ended in victory in 1984. The FBI agreed to destroy his file and acknowledge that collecting the information found within the file violated his constitutional rights.

 Throughout his legal career, Jabara would take on nationally prominent cases of Arabs and Arab-Americans.
Such cases included Sirhan B. Sirhan, convicted for the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, and Ziad Abu Eain, wanted for extradition to Israel for a 1979 Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) bombing. Jabara also worked as part of the defense team for Omar Ahmad Ali Abdel Rahman, who was accused of plotting to destroy New York City landmarks and the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.

 Jabara was also involved in the National Lawyer's Guild (NLG), an organization founded as an alternative to the more conservative American Bar Association. In 1977, he traveled to Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, and the Occupied Territories as part of the NLG's Middle East delegation to report on the condition and treatment of Palestinians living in the Occupied Territories. Jabara became president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in 1986. The ADC, founded by former Senator James Abourezk in 1980, devoted itself to the protection of the rights of people of Arab descent and the promotion of their cultural heritage. In 2002, Jabara worked for the ADC Research Institute in Washington D.C. He served as president of the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, former board member of the Center for Constitutional Rights, and former co-counsel with Lynne Stewart for Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman. As of January 2016, Jabara is a member of the legal advisory board for the American Muslim Council and an active member of the National Lawyers Guild.",9591; 8514; 5782; 4604; 7164; 8210; 8515; 8516; 18048; 5794; 6774; 10521; 6294; 6295; 18047; 17465; 6435,"Arab Americans.; Arab Americans; Arab Americans; Emigration and immigration.; Environmentalism; Human rights.; Human rights; Human rights; Islam; Lawyers; Political action committees.; Religion and politics.; September 11 Terrorist Attacks, 2001.; Terrorism.; Trials (Terrorism); Correspondence.; Court records.",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,3142,Photographs.,aat,2130; 2131; 2153; 1827; 4446; 2003,Israel; Lebanon; Middle East.; Palestine.; United States; United States,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lcsh,5600; 713; 2652; 4693,"Jabara, Abdeen.; Abu Ayn, Ziyad.; Jabara, Abdeen, 1940-; Sirhan, Sirhan Bishara, 1944-",lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf,5035; 2187; 5262,American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.; B'nai B'rith.

Eventually named the Interfaith Council For Peace, the group's key organizer was Barbara Fuller, a representative of Memorial Christian Church in Ann Arbor. The Interfaith Council was chartered as a local chapter of the larger, national anti-war coalition, Clergy and Laity Concerned about Vietnam (name later changed to Clergy and Laity Concerned).

 As opposition to the Vietnam War grew, both CALC and the IFC arranged a continuing series of activities and events designed to increase public dissatisfaction with the war and bring the conflict to a speedy conclusion. Barbara Fuller, in addition to her responsibilities in Ann Arbor, became an important figure in CALC. She served as the organization's regional coordinator for the Midwest and also was a member of CALC's national executive board.

 The eventual conclusion of the war led to a re-evaluation of purpose among all anti-war groups. In Ann Arbor the Interfaith Council for Peace turned its attention to questions of social justice, particularly amnesty, human rights and world hunger. The IFC became the coordinating agency for an annual ""hunger walk"" in the community, an event designed to both dramatize the plight of the starving and to educate local residents about this problem. In 1988, the organization formally changed its name to the Interfaith Council for Peace and Justice (ICPJ).

 Through the 1990s and 2000s, the ICPJ was highly involved in a wide variety of activities at the local, state, national and international levels. The group's yearly and monthly listings of events attest to their ongoing dedication to peace and justice and their high level of activism during this time. They continued their administrative role of the annual CROP Walk and also raised awareness regarding local hunger, homelessness, and welfare issues. They also held numerous protests and vigils to raise public awareness about the war in Bosnia, the ""School of Assassins"" at Fort Benning, support for a nuclear test ban, and opposition to U.S. bombings in Iraq. In addition, they hosted annually a day of ""peaceful"" events in remembrance of the bombing of Hiroshima, and in the late 1990s began training and coordinating a ""Peace Team"" to staff the local KKK rallies and anti-KKK protests in Ann Arbor.",8459; 8460; 6901; 3715; 6170; 8461; 5809; 5812; 4523; 8462; 5878,"Amnesty.; Arab-Israeli conflict; Civil rights; Demonstrations.; Disarmament.; Hunger.; Jewish-Arab relations.; Peace; Protest movements.; Race discrimination.; Vietnam War, 1961-1975.",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lcsh; lcsh,3191; 3142; 3144; 3141,Digital file formats.; Photographs.; Sound recordings.; Videotapes.,aat; aat; aat; aat,861; 2120; 2121,Ann Arbor (Mich.); Latin America; United States,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,,,,3969; 3969; 3986; 107; 3986,"Interfaith Council for Peace and Justice (Ann Arbor, Mich.); Interfaith Council for Peace and Justice (Ann Arbor, Mich.); Clergy and Laity Concerned (U.S.); St. Clare of Assisi Episcopal Church (Ann Arbor, Mich.); Clergy and Laity Concerned (U.S.)",lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf,,,

He graduated from Grand Rapids High School in 1900 and studied for a year at the University of Michigan (1900-1901). Although he received numerous honorary law and other degrees later in life, this marked the end of his formal education.

 Vandenberg first started out to be a journalist and author. He dropped out of college in 1901 to work full-time at the Grand Rapids Herald, where as a young man he had worked as a copy boy. For a short time he worked at Collier's Weekly magazine in New York, but returned home in 1905 to marry Elizabeth Watson. In 1906, he went back to the Herald, becoming its editor, and after 1919, its financial manager as well. During this period, Vandenberg wrote three books: The Greatest American: Alexander Hamilton (1921), If Hamilton Were Here Today (1923), and The Trail of a Tradition (1926). He remained at the Herald until 1928 when he left for Washington and the U.S. Senate.

 In this first phase of his career, Vandenberg was both a newspaperman and a local political figure. He was a member of the Grand Rapids Charter Commission in 1910, a member of the Republican State Central Committee from 1912 to 1918, and chairman of the Republican State Convention in 1916 and 1928 In addition, the editorials he wrote, especially those relating to problems of local government, brought Vandenberg to the public's attention and he became a noteworthy figure in the state Republican party.

 In 1928, Vandenberg was appointed to fill a Republican vacancy on the U.S. Senate. He was elected in his own right that same year and then re-elected in 1934, 1940, and 1946. When he died in 1951, he was still in office. During the 72nd Congress Vandenberg was chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills, during the 79th he was chairman of the Republican Conference, and during the 80th he was President pro tempore of the Senate and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Three times his name came up as a possibility for President of the United States, in 1936, 1940 and again in 1948, although he was never nominated to run.

 Although he had been a staunch isolationist, having opposed U.S. participation in the League of Nations during the 1930s, Vandenberg gradually converted his thinking to internationalism. In a speech he made to the Senate in January 1945, he committed himself to the idea of one world, stating that no nation could exist safely on its own and emphasizing that the United States had to be a leader in world affairs. After that speech, President Roosevelt named him a delegate to the charter conference for the United Nations, convened in San Francisco in 1945. Vandenberg also became a delegate to the first and second United Nations General Assemblies in London and New York in 1946. In 1947, he was a delegate to the Pan American Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He was actively involved in getting bipartisan support for U.S. ratification of the U.N. Charter in 1945; in winning the Senate's approval of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan; and in forming the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, authoring the Vandenberg Resolution which was approved by the Senate in 1948.

 In 1906 Vandenberg married Elizabeth Watson, whom he had known for much of his life. Their three children were Arthur Jr., Barbara, and Elizabeth. She died in 1916 and Vandenberg married Hazel Whitaker in 1918. The second Mrs. Vandenberg died in 1950. The senator died of cancer on April 18, 1951, and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Grand Rapids, his lifelong home.",5742; 7953; 7800; 10643; 8086; 8088; 10644; 10645; 6098; 7081; 7335; 8243; 6123; 6503; 5429; 3584; 4263; 3649; 3944; 3770; 4987; 8197; 4988; 5479; 3579; 5769; 5738,"African Americans.; Nuclear energy.; Banks and banking; Children; Communism.; Jews; Labor movement.; Neutrality.; Polish Americans; Presidents; Presidents; Presidents; Tariff; Taxation; Cigars.; Clothing and dress.; Festivals.; Interiors.; Military parades and ceremonies.; Offices.; Politics and government; Politics and government; Public speaking.; Telephones; Women.; World War, 1914-1918.; World War, 1939-1945.",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lcsh,3471; 3482; 3468; 3152; 3443; 3142; 3140; 3144; 3141,Albums.; Caricatures.; Cartoons.; Diaries.; Motion pictures.; Photographs.; Scrapbooks.; Sound recordings.; Videotapes.,gmgpc; gmgpc; gmgpc; aat; lcsh; aat; aat; aat; aat,947; 2999; 1700; 971; 1639; 1638; 1105; 966,China; Florida Ship Canal (Projected); Isle Royale (Mich.); Israel.; Saint Lawrence Seaway.; United States; Grand Rapids (Mich.); United States,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,3690; 1888; 717; 3690; 1726; 3615; 893; 5393; 3690; 2920; 6629; 1310; 7116; 1523; 2789; 4674; 5442; 6452; 1050; 7439; 6701; 5455; 219; 1030; 3634; 6432; 6855; 6270; 871; 8688; 3992; 2718; 4194; 5620; 2637; 7694; 7317; 5304; 5077; 3032; 4620; 2676; 3155; 4335; 1848; 6863; 7603; 8112; 8875; 2929; 1327; 4325; 1226; 2346; 3314; 3901; 5738; 7364; 9033; 8675; 7719; 5770; 5844; 2894; 6534; 1549; 3625; 4159; 3805; 2404; 7404; 3360; 2949; 354; 6239; 2896; 2105; 1757; 3172; 6214; 8797; 4293; 4999; 8978; 1883; 7653; 2231; 4023; 4931; 5066; 970; 1192; 1575; 3217; 1451; 5715; 2960; 7346; 7135; 435; 2090; 7480; 1370; 7580; 6083; 5527; 8503; 3549; 3729; 5103; 567; 3265; 2735; 2308; 1499; 717; 3856; 7220; 1726; 4411; 8534; 8836; 9067; 7910; 1873; 1044; 7537; 3297; 5401; 1345; 1276; 3621; 4824; 7222; 6154; 5412; 6790; 8928; 4066; 4913; 7163; 6532; 2417; 6884; 820; 3983; 782; 1994; 6877; 748; 1628; 203; 2117; 5272; 2856; 906; 3688; 6669; 1702; 3615; 2943; 6930; 7170; 1627; 2278; 8244; 2680; 893; 1110; 4082; 238; 557; 2934; 546; 726; 102; 3101; 8002; 7968; 6629; 2725; 2575; 1433; 4269; 4061; 1832; 3690; 6884,"Vandenberg, Arthur H.

Records include committees minutes, correspondence, curricular records, syllabi and student evaluations of the program.","In the 1960s, the University of Michigan College of Literature, Science and the Arts established and administered student overseas travel and study programs, including the Junior Year Abroad Program in Aix-en-Provence, France and Freiburg, Germany. In the early 1970s, the college centralized administration of the programs in the Center for Western European Studies (CWES), which received funding for this work from the Ford Foundation. By that time the programs included a joint program with Sarah Lawrence University in London, and the University of Michigan-University of Wisconsin Academic Year Program in Italy, which is situated in Florence. Funding from the Ford Foundation ended in 1977, and the college resumed financial support for the programs. Some university departments organized their own programs. The Romance Languages and Literatures department, for example, supervised two: one at the University of Salamanca in Spain and one at the University of Tours in France. All overseas travel and study programs were directed and staffed by senior faculty from Michigan or from the cooperating institutions.

 In 1983, CWES was reorganized and given control over all international study programs, including those in departments. CWES established an executive committee as the agent to oversee operations, and four other committees to handle various tasks. The committees included: Foreign Study, International Exchange and Fellowships, On-campus Programs, and Colloquia and Conferences. The members of the executive committee included the director and associate director, a past director, and each of the four committee chairs. With this reorganization several new programs were inaugurated, including four in Britain, and one in Paris. The executive committee members in conjunction with the dean of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts appointed the CWES director who served a three-year term.

 In 1989, the Office of International Programs (OIP) replaced the Center for Western European Studies as the overseeing agency for study abroad programs. The OIP was later replaced by the Center for Global and Intercultural Study (CGIS), which was founded in July 2009 to provide a wide variety of global engagement and learning opportunities to the University of Michigan Community. Today, the CGIS offers over 70 programs in over 30 countries, serving ""students with diverse academic interests at international and domestic sites on every inhabited continent.

Reports, email correspondence, meeting agendas and minutes, student resources, photographs, project files, and an archived website.",The finding aid is written in English,"The Islamophobia Working Group records (266.4 MB and 1 archived websites) contains progress reports, email correspondence, meeting agendas and minutes, photographs, student outreach resources, project files, and an archived website. The materials are organized into two series, the Islamophobia Working Group records series and the Islamophobia Working Group website series.","The Islamophobia Working Group (IWG) formed in January 2016 to examine how Islamophobia and anti-Muslim racism in the United States affects the campus climate at the University of Michigan. Rising anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States and across the world has led to increased harassment and bias against Muslims and those perceived as Muslim including Sikhs and individuals of Middle Eastern/North African descent. The Arab and Muslim Studies Program (AMAS) in the Department of American Culture originally sponsored the Islamophobia Working Group, which is comprised of faculty, staff, and student volunteers. The IWG works with the University of Michigan's strategic plan for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) to identify ways to create an inclusive campus for all community members impacted by Islamophobia.


One of the IWG's key initiatives is establishing reflection rooms to provide space for Muslim students to pray on campus. The IWG created a guide for campus buildings about how to create reflection rooms that are safe, secure and meet the religious needs of Muslim students.  Since January 2016, new reflection rooms have opened on Central and North campus including Haven Hall, North Quad, and the Electrical Engineering Computer Science Building. 


Another major project is creating a racial category for Middle Eastern/North African (MENA) on University documents such as undergraduate applications and faculty and staff job applications. Currently, individuals of MENA descent are categorized as ""White"" on these materials.  The IWG argued adding this category would provide MENA respondents an option that better reflects their personal identity and experiences. It would also allow the University to gather better data about the MENA population on campus, allowing the community to better advocate for its needs. The initiative has garnered wide support across the University of Michigan. In February 2017, the Central Student Government (CSG) passed a resolution advocating for adding a MENA category to University documents, which was approved by 15 other student governments across campus. Over 700 faculty and staff across the Ann Arbor, Flint, and Dearborn campuses of the University of Michigan have signed a petition letter supporting the cause. Members of the IWG have met with campus leaders, including President Mark Schlissel, about moving forward with adding the MENA designation to University materials. 


The IWG has also lobbied for the University to stop using the al-Kittab textbook for Arab language instruction.  They argue the text prioritizes teaching political and military vocabulary that promotes stereotypes about Arab culture. The IWG has taken a number of steps to raise awareness about its concerns with the al-Kittab. In September 2017, the IWG formed the al-Kittab Exploratory Committee with leaders from the Center for Middle Eastern and North African Studies (CMENAS) and the Near Eastern Studies Department.  In November 2017, two student members of the IWG attended the Middle East Studies Association conference in Washington D.C. and presented at a workshop and poster session.


The IWG has sponsored lectures and events to raise awareness of Islamophobia and has organized self-defense classes for community members concerned about their safety. In 2017, the group hosted Muslim Diag Day, an event intended to facilitate conversations between Muslim and non-Muslim students in the hopes of dispelling stereotypes and misconceptions about Islam. In the 2018-2019 school year, the IWG became co-led by the Arab and Muslim Studies Program and the Center for Middle Eastern and North African Studies. The Islamophobia Working Group continues to identify and address issues of Islamophobia affecting the University of Michigan community.

The material is generally in English, unless otherwise noted. The collection contains the following series: Imam Mohamad Jawad Chirri, Islamic Center of America, Zehia Kahil and Publications.","Imam Mohamad Jawad Chirri was born in Lebanon on October 1, 1905. He was a graduate of the theological Institute of An-Najaf Al-Ashraf University in Iraq. In 1948, the small Muslim community in the Detroit area invited Imam Chirri to the United States of America. As the spiritual leader to the primarily Lebanese-American community, Imam Chirri envisioned the construction of a new mosque which would help strengthen the local Muslim population as well as enlightened non-Muslims throughout America on the practices of Islam.

 In 1959, a little over a decade after arriving in America, Imam Chirri traveled to Egypt seeking financial assistance for the construction of the mosque he envisioned for the growing Detroit area Muslim community. While in Egypt, Imam Chirri met with President Jamal Abdul Nasser who provided the Islamic Center with a donation large enough to purchase land on Joy Road and Greenfield. During his visit to Egypt, Imam Chirri also met with Sheikh Mahmood Shaltut, Imam of the Al-Azhar University of Cairo. The two spiritual leaders participated in lengthy discussions about the similarities between Shi-ite Jaafari and Sunnite. After their discussions, Imam Shaltut made the historic announcement declaring the equality between the Shi-ite Jaafari and Sunnite Schools.

 Three years after his trip to Egypt, the Islamic Center of Detroit (which would later be renamed the Islamic Center of America) opened its doors in 1962. The new center and mosque allowed for weekly Sunday services and became the social center of the strengthening community.

 Along with being the founder of the Islamic Center of America, Imam Chirri was a renowned author and lecturer. Imam Chirri published widely in Arabic, but the self-taught English speaker also wrote many celebrated works in English. Some of his writings include <title render=""italic"">Inquiries About Islam</title>, <title render=""italic"">The Faith of Islam</title>, and <title render=""italic"">Imam Hussein, Leader of the Martyrs</title>. His writings and position as the director of the Islamic Center of America made Imam Chirri a widely sought after authority on Islam. His views and insights on topics related to Islam and the Muslim community were often quoted in the national media.

 Over a decade after Imam Mohamad Jawad Chirri's death in 1994, the Islamic Center of America opened a new center on Ford Road in 2005.

Atwell graduated from Fordson High School in 1952, and married John Atwell in 1952. The Atwells had eight children, divorcing in 1972. Atwell received her BA in Urban and Regional Studies from University of Michigan-Dearborn in 1978.

 Since the 1960's, Atwell has been an activist and volunteer in her community of Southeast Dearborn. She volunteered at the Southeast Dearborn Community Council (SEDCC), then served as the executive director from 1978 until the organization folded in 1986. Atwell was a key activist in the southeast area's struggle against the City of Dearborn's desire for urban renewal, as well as the author of several federal grants that led to the construction of low-income housing and the redevelopment of the Dix and Vernor business district as the 'Arabian Village'.

 Atwell was one of the founders of the Arab Community Center for Economics and Social Services (ACCESS), serving as the first treasurer and continually an active board member. Atwell volunteered at the American Muslim Society, which her parents helped establish. Eventually the Mosque split into two factions, and the early Lebanese community left and began a new association called American Bekka Center. Atwell served on the Women's Auxiliary in both organizations, and became the first female board member at the Bekka Center. Atwell now serves as the Bekka Center's first female vice-president.

 In addition to Atwell's work at the SEDCC, ACCESS and the Mosques, she was also active in a number of other organizations including the Salina School District PTA, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, the Lebanese Club, the Arab American Political Committee, the Arab Democratic Club, and the Arab World Festival.

 After leaving the SEDCC in 1986, Atwell joined the staff of State Senator Agnes Dubronski as a Legislative Aid. In 1991 she became the Executive Director of the Metro Detroit Service Station Dealers' Association. In the mid-1990's Atwell joined other family members in running a small business.

Hassen also acted as a liaison between the Federation of Islamic Associations of the United States and Canada and the U.S. Black Muslim movement known as the Nation of Islam. It was during this period that Hassen formed a lasting friendship with Malcolm X. Her friendship and correspondence with Malcolm X grew out of her work to unite Islamic organizations and to spread the message of an egalitarian Islam. Her work led her to the Middle East where she made a pilgrimage to Mecca and developed friendships with Arab leaders.

 In 1972, Aliya Ogdie-Hassen moved back to Detroit and assisted in the development of the newly formed Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services (ACCESS).

 By 1929, the Shikany family had moved from Minneapolis to Detroit. During this time, Woody began his first job in the automobile industry working for the Hudson Motor Car Company installing axles. After a few years of assembling automobiles, Woody decided he would rather be responsible for selling automobiles. Woody got his opportunity in 1936 when the Mack-Gratiot Chevrolet Company hired him for a sales position. After less than two years of selling Chevrolets for Mack-Gratiot Chevrolet, Woody left the company to go into business for himself. He purchased a used car lot on Vernor and Mt. Eliot in Detroit and opened Liberty Motor Sales.

 Soon after, in 1939, Woody applied for a Pontiac franchise in Hamtramck. Woody Pontiac Sales, Inc. was established on January 2, 1940.

The first is the papers of Ruthven as president of the University of Michigan, 1929 to 1951. The second, and smaller, series is the files maintained by Ruthven as a zoologist with the University Museum and as professor of zoology. This latter series dates largely from 1908 to 1929 but also includes collected earlier files from the 1870s.","Alexander G. Ruthven was born April 1, 1882 in Hull, Iowa. He received his BS degree in 1903 from Morningside College and his Ph.D. in Zoology from the University of Michigan. As a zoologist, Ruthven's major interest was in reptiles and amphibians - snakes, lizards turtles, frogs, etc. He wrote extensively in his disciple and also directed various scientific expeditions in North, South and Central America. Also, before assuming the presidency, Ruthven was chief field naturalist with the Michigan Geological and Biological Survey (1908-1912).

 Ruthven's entire career was spent at the University of Michigan where he was successively instructor of zoology and curator of the Museum of Zoology (1906-1911); assistant professor and curator of the Museum of Zoology (1911-1913); assistant professor and director of the Museum of Zoology (1913-1915); profess and director of the Museum of Zoology (1915-1929); director of University Museums (1922-1936); chairman of the department of zoology and director of the Zoological Laboratories (1927-1929); and dean of administration (1928-1929). Upon President Little's resignation, Ruthven was named to a committee of three to administer the affairs of the University. With administrative skills demonstrated in this position, Ruthven in October 1929 was selected by the regents as president of the University of Michigan. He served in this position until 1951 when Harlan Hatcher assumed office.

 Upon assuming office as president, Ruthven worked to reform the administrative structure of the university. He believed that the university must distribute authority and responsibility among the many units and officers which make up the total structure. Early on he selected two vice-presidents, one in charge of business affairs and the other in charge of educational investigations. He also appointed a director of plant extension, and some time later, a vice-president in charge of university relations outside the campus. In 1944, the university's administrative structure included a provost, two vice-presidents, and a secretary. Deans and directors of schools, colleges, and other educational units were given authority commensurate with their responsibilities. Usually, advisory or executive committees were set up to aid unit heads with their duties.

 During Ruthven's tenure, the School of Music was formally affiliated and integration with the university.

 Recorded reminiscences of Morton J. Netzorg and Petra Fuld Netzorg.","<persname normal=""Netzorg, Morton I."">Morton I. Netzorg</persname> and <persname normal=""Netzorg, Katherine S."">Katherine S. Netzorg</persname> were both born in 1884. Morton was a Michigan native and a University of Michigan graduate (Literature, 1910). They came to the Philippines in 1911 to teach in the Philippine public schools as part of the Tomasites teacher corps. They had three children: Morton Jacob (born in 1912), called by most ""Jock"", David Leon, and Leah. Morton and Katherine soon became prominent and active members of the <geogname normal=""Manila (Philippines)"">Manila</geogname> Jewish community, public figures, and business owners. In the 1930s Morton I. worked on bringing European Jewish refugees to the Philippines as the Jewish Refugee Committee secretary. After the Japanese forces occupied Manila on January 2, 1942 Morton I. and Katherine were imprisoned in the <corpname normal=""Santo Tomas Internment Camp (Manila, Philippines)"">Santo Tomas</corpname> internment camp. They were liberated by the American forces in early February 1945. In April 1945 Morton became Regional Director of the Manila branch of the National Jewish Welfare Board and worked to organize community services and activities, and services for Jewish military personnel in the Philippines. In spring 1946 Morton I. Netzorg returned to the United States and died very suddenly shortly after his arrival. Katherine, who also returned, died in 1949. David L. Netzorg died of malaria in Japanese POW camp in 1942. Leah (married name Stine) resided in the United States.

 <persname normal=""Netzorg, Morton J."">Morton J. Netzorg</persname> arrived in the United States before the start of the War. There he met <persname normal=""Netzorg, Petra Fuld"">Hannelore ""Floh"" Fuld</persname> (born in 1923), a Jewish emigrant from <geogname normal=""Berlin (Germany)"">Berlin, Germany</geogname>. Hannelore subsequently changed her name to Petra and was known as Petra or Pete for the rest of her life. Morton J. and Petra were married in 1941 and had two children, Susan and David.

 In the 1950s the Netzorgs settled in <geogname normal=""Detroit (Mich.)"">Detroit, Michigan</geogname> and opened the <corpname normal=""Cellar Book Shop (Detroit, Mich.)"">Cellar Book Shop</corpname> specializing in material published in and about the Southeast Asia region and the Philippines and the <geogname normal=""Pasific islands"">Pacific Islands</geogname> in particular, as well as East and South Asia, and Africa. Their business became the essential source of material dedicated to these regions in North America. Morton acquired warehouses of books, maps and other Filipiniana material, and shipped them to Detroit. He built the largest collection of Philippine children's book and textbooks. Morton himself became one of the most important bibliographers of the Philippines. He published extensively in Kinaadman (Wisdom), journal published in the Philippines, and other scholarly journals, and authored a number of important Filipiniana bibliographies and bibliographical essays, notably about children's literature and about the World War II period in the Philippines, as well as memoirs.

 Morton J. Netzorg died in 1995. Petra Fuld Netzorg continued running the Cellar Book Shop for a few years until her retirement. She died in 2008.

 Petra's mother <persname normal=""Charlotte Fuld"">Charlotte ""Lotte"" Fuld</persname> and her younger sister <persname normal=""Fuld, Bracha, 1926-1946"">Barbara ""Bracha""</persname> (born in 1926) left Germany for England in 1938, then settled in the <geogname normal=""Palestine"">British Mandate Palestine</geogname> in 1939. Petra's father Lothar Fuld stayed in Nazi Germany. He committed suicide after the pogroms of November 1938. As a teenager Bracha joined the Jewish Resistance movement against the British authorities in Palestine.

Kevorkian's parents, Lewis (Levon) (1887-1960) and Satenig Kevorkian (1900-1968), were immigrants from Armenia. Lewis came to the U.S. prior to World War I from Passem, Erzerum (modern Turkey). At first he was employed by an automobile foundry. He soon enrolled in a night school to improve his English and learn mathematics. Lewis built the house where Jack Kevorkian was born. In the early 1930's Lewis lost his job at the automobile foundry but found work with a contractor, and in time became a successful sewer and water main contractor, making a sizeable living as the owner of his own excavating company.

 At 15 years of age Satenig witnessed the horrors of the 1915 Armenian genocide. She fled her native Govdun, Sepastia, finding refuge with relatives in Paris, and eventually reuniting with her brother in Pontiac. Lewis and Satenig met through the Armenian community in Pontiac, where they married and started a family. The couple had three children: Margaret, Jack, and Flora. Satenig's tales of the genocide became part of the family legacy, influencing Jack Kevorkian.

 Kevorkian's older sister Margaret (Margo) was born in 1926. An avid reader and learner, Margaret travelled with her mother in the Near East and Europe, later enrolling in art courses at the Cranbrook Institute of Science in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. She variously worked for the Michigan Children's Aid Society, General Motors, and for the MacManus, John, and Adams International Advertising Agency in Bloomfield Hills. Jack and Margaret Kevorkian, who died in 1994, were very close. It was Margaret's daughter, Ava Janus, who donated Jack Kevorkian's papers to the Bentley Historical Library. Kevorkian's younger sister Flora married Hermann Holzheimer, a German diplomat. Both sisters helped him in the 1990's with his first physician-assisted suicide.

 As children, the three Kevorkian siblings were encouraged to perform well in school, and all demonstrated high academic performance. Jack was able to enter Eastern Junior High School when he was in the 6th grade, and by the time he was in high school he had taught himself German and Japanese in preparation for military service, but World War II ended before he came of military age. His interest in languages, specifically, the origin and complexities of words, continued throughout his life. The young Jack Kevorkian was described by his friends as an able student interested in art and music. He graduated with honors from Pontiac High School in 1945 at the age of 17.

 Kevorkian attended the University of Michigan School of Engineering between 1946 and 1948. He planned to be a civil engineer, but in the middle of his freshman year he began focusing on botany and biology. He also took classes in chemistry, mathematics, engineering drawing, rhetoric, history, psychology, German, and Japanese. By mid-year, he had set his sights on medical school, often taking 20 credit-hours in a semester to meet the 90-hour medical school requirement. He graduated with a degree in Clinical Pathology in 1952 and completed his internship at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit (1952/1953).

 From 1953 to 1955, Kevorkian served for 15 months as First Lieutenant General Medical Officer in preventive medicine in Korea. While in Korea, he put his Japanese language skills to use in medical intelligence.

 Upon his return to the U.S., Kevorkian entered a medical residency in Pathologic Anatomy at the University of Michigan Hospital. While serving his residency, Kevorkian became fascinated by death and the act of dying. He made regular visits to terminally ill patients, photographing their eyes in an attempt to pinpoint the exact moment of death. Kevorkian believed that doctors could use the information to distinguish death from fainting, shock, or coma, to determine a point at which resuscitation was useless.

 Dr. Kevorkian's first scientific article was published in the <title render=""italic"">American Journal of Pathology</title> in 1956. In addition to medical articles, he began writing on the subjects of the death penalty and the participation of prisoners in clinical research. He caused a stir with colleagues by proposing that death-row prison inmates could be used as the subjects of medical experiments while they were still alive. Inspired by research that described medical experiments the ancient Greeks conducted on Egyptian criminals, Kevorkian formulated the idea that similar modern experiments could not only save valuable research dollars but also provide a glimpse into the anatomy of the criminal mind. In 1958, he advocated his view in a paper presented to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. His ideas earned him the nickname ""Dr. Death"" and some minor media attention and resulted in his ejection from the University of Michigan medical residency program. Dr. Kevorkian finished his residency at Pontiac General Hospital (1959-1960).

 While still in Pontiac, Kevorkian heard about experiments transfusing blood from corpses into living patients, performed by a team of Soviet researchers, and he enlisted the help of medical technologist Neal Nicol to simulate these same experiments. The results were highly successful, and Kevorkian believed the procedure could help save lives on the battlefield; if blood from a bank was unavailable, doctors might transfuse the blood of a corpse into an injured soldier. Kevorkian pitched his idea to the Pentagon, figuring it could be used in Vietnam, but he was denied a federal grant to continue his research. Instead, the research only confirmed his reputation as an outsider and jolted his colleagues. Also during this time, as a result of his experimentations, Kevorkian became infected with Hepatitis C.

 During the 1960's Kevorkian held appointments as Associate Pathologist at St. Joseph Hospital in Ann Arbor (December 1960-July 1961), Associate Pathologist at Pontiac General Hospital (1961-1966), and Medical Director at the Medical Diagnostic Center in Southfield (1967-1969). Also in the 1960's Kevorkian enrolled in an adult education oil painting class in Pontiac. In his art he combined his understanding of the human anatomy with his fascination with death. Kevorkian continued to paint throughout his lifetime. He was also a skilled jazz musician and a composer.

 In the 1970's Kevorkian worked as a pathologist at Saratoga General Hospital in Detroit (1970-1976). During this period he published more than 30 journal articles and booklets about his philosophy on death. In 1976 he moved to California, where he held two part-time pathology jobs in Long Beach. In 1984, prompted by the growing number of executions in the U.S., Kevorkian advocated the idea of giving death-row inmates a choice--to donate their organs and die by anesthesia rather than poison gas or the electric chair. He was invited to brief members of the California Legislature on a bill that would enable prisoners to have this choice. His actions received the attention of the media, and he became involved in the growing national debate on dying with dignity.

 Following a dispute with a chief pathologist, Kevorkian claimed that his career was doomed by physicians who feared his radical ideas. He ""retired"" to devote his time to painting, music, and a documentary project on Handel's <title render=""italic"">Messiah</title> as well as to continue his research for his death-row campaign. Before Kevorkian left California, in 1984, his artwork, musical instruments, compositions, videos, master films, research papers, library, and all of his personal belongings were stolen from a storage facility. Kevorkian did not paint again until 1993, when he recreated some of the 18 pieces of his stolen art.

 I Kevorkian returned to Michigan in 1985. He moved to a small apartment in Royal Oak and wrote a comprehensive history of experiments on executed humans, which was published in the <title render=""italic"">Journal of the National Medical Association</title>. In 1986 he discovered a way to expand his death-row proposal when he learned that doctors in the Netherlands were helping people die by lethal injection. In 1987 Kevorkian visited the Netherlands, where he studied techniques that allowed Dutch physicians to assist in the suicides of terminally ill patients without interference from the legal authorities.

 Kevorkian began writing new articles, this time about self-administered euthanasia, or Medicide, as he called physician-assisted suicide. He created a machine he called the ""Thanatron"" (Greek for ""instrument of death""), which he assembled out of $45 worth of materials. The Thanatron consisted of three bottles that delivered successive doses of fluids: first a saline solution, followed by a painkiller and, finally, the poison potassium chloride. The Thanatron enabled self-administration of a lethal dose of the fluids. After years of rejection from national medical journals and media outlets, Kevorkian became the focus of national attention for his machine and his proposal to set up ""obitoriums,"" where doctors could help the terminally ill end their lives. He began to advertise in Detroit-area newspapers for an obitorium that would offer ""death counseling"" for the terminally ill and their families. Kevorkian intended to personally bear all the expenses of Medicide.

 Due to media interest, Kevorkian's ideas became known to the general public. In 1990 he was contacted by Janet Adkins, a 54-year-old Oregon woman who suffered from Alzheimer's, an incurable condition that causes progressive loss of memory, insight, and other mental functions. Adkins was a member of the Hemlock Society, a national right-to-die organization that she had joined before she became ill--and asked Kevorkian to help her in ending her life. Janet and her husband, Ron Adkins, traveled to Detroit. On June 4, 1990, Kevorkian assisted her in ending her life, on a bed inside his 1968 Volkswagen van, parked in a campground near his home in Michigan. Immediately after Adkin's passing, Kevorkian called the police, who arrested and briefly detained him. Ron Adkins and two of his sons held a news conference in Portland and read the suicide note Mrs. Adkins had prepared. Janet Adkins was the first person to be assisted by Kevorkian in Medicide.

 After the Adkins story reached the media, Kevorkian became a national celebrity. The State of Michigan immediately charged Kevorkian with Adkins' murder, but in December 1990 District Court Judge Gerald McNally dismissed murder charge against Kevorkian due to Michigan's indecisive stance on physician-assisted suicide.

 In October 1991 Kevorkian attended the deaths of Marjorie Wantz, a 58-year-old woman from Sodus, Michigan, who suffered from pelvic pain, and Sherry Miller, a 43-year-old woman from Roseville, Michigan, who suffered from multiple sclerosis. Both deaths occurred at a rented state park cabin near Lake Orion, Michigan.

 Following these deaths a Michigan judge issued an injunction barring Kevorkian's use of the Medicide machine, and in November 1991 Kevorkian's Michigan medical license was revoked by the state Board of Medicine. When a medical examiner ruled that the deaths of the two women were homicides, Kevorkian was charged in February 1992 with two charges of murder and one count of illegally providing a controlled substance. Unable to gather the medications needed to use the Thanatron, Kevorkian assembled a new machine, called the Mercitron, which delivered carbon monoxide through a gas mask.

 While on bail awaiting his trial, Kevorkian was frequently contacted by terminally ill patients and members of their families asking for help. To ensure the comfort of those he assisted and to protect himself against criminal charges, Kevorkian began requiring documentation of a person's wish to die. Family physicians, mental health professionals, social workers, and religious leaders were consulted. His patients had at least one month to consider their decisions and possibly change their minds. Kevorkian's sister, Margaret, videotaped his consultations with ""Medicide families."" He also spoke on the phone and corresponded with a California dentist who sought assistance in constructing a Medicide machine to end his own life.

 Oakland County Circuit Court Judge David Breck dismissed charges against Kevorkian in the deaths of Miller and Wantz in July 1992, but the Oakland County Prosecutor, Richard Thompson, appealed this decision.

 In December 1992 the State of Michigan passed a bill outlawing assisted suicide, to take effect on March 30, 1993. On February 15, 1993, Kevorkian helped Hugh Gale, a 73-year-old man with emphysema and congestive heart disease, die in the patient's Roseville, Michigan, home. Prosecutors later discovered papers that showed Kevorkian altered his account of Gale's death, deleting a reference to a request by Gale to halt the procedure.

 On February 25, 1993, Michigan Governor John Engler signed legislation banning assisted suicide. In April of that same year a California judge suspended Kevorkian's medical license after a request from that state's Medical Board.

 On August 9, 1993, Thomas Hyde, a 30-year-old Novi, Michigan, man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), was found dead in Kevorkian's van on Belle Isle, a Detroit park. On September 9, hours after a judge ordered Kevorkian to stand trial in Hyde's death, Kevorkian was present at the death of cancer patient Donald O'Keefe, 73, in Redford Township, Michigan.

 Jailed in Detroit after refusing to post $20,000 bond in the case involving Thomas Hyde's death, Kevorkian fasted from November 5-8, 1993, before being released. Later that same month, Kevorkian was charged in the October 1993 death of 72-year-old Merian Frederick of Ann Arbor, Michigan, who suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease, and was held in an Oakland County jail for refusing to post $50,000 bond. Kevorkian began another fast (November 29-December 17) and left jail after an Oakland County Circuit Court judge reduced his bond to $100 in exchange for Kevorkian's vow not to assist in any more suicides until state courts resolve the legality of his practice.

 The first trial of Dr. Kevorkian began in Pontiac on April 19, 1994. The prosecution charged Kevorkian with murder by administering drugs to Thomas Hyde, assisting him to commit suicide. The trial was presided over by Judge Thomas Jackson, and Richard Thompson led the prosecution. Kevorkian was represented by Geoffrey Fieger of Fieger, Fieger, Kenney, Johnson &amp; Giroux of Southfield, Michigan. Fieger helped Kevorkian escape conviction by successfully arguing that a person may not be found guilty of criminally assisting a suicide if they administered medication with the ""intent to relieve pain and suffering,"" even if it did increase the risk of death. Fieger also brought in Mayer ""Mike"" Morganroth as co-counsel. Morganroth had 40 years of extensive high-profile criminal trial experience (including cases involving Lyndon Larouche, Mayor Coleman Young, the DeLorean Motor Company, Carolyn Warmus, and the Hierarchy of the Teamsters). Fieger counseled Kevorkian for 6.5 years, while Morganroth co-counseled for a good portion of that period. Morganroth represented Jack Kevorkian for 16.5 years (11 years as sole lead counsel) with respect to a wide range of matters, including criminal trials as co-counsel with Geoffrey Fieger, all of which resulted in acquittal or dismissal of charges; the successful petition for early release of Kevorkian from prison; appeals; and entertainment matters, including book deals, lecture deals, and movie and documentary deals. The jury found Kevorkian not guilty of violating the Michigan law that prohibited assisted suicide in the case of Thomas Hyde's death on May 2. On May 10, 1994, Michigan Court of Appeals declared that the state's 1993 ban on assisted suicide was enacted unlawfully. The court voided the assisted-suicide law, saying it violated the state constitution, which required a bill to have a single object.

 On December 13, 1994, the state legislature failed to reach agreement on a bill that would make the ban on assisted suicide indefinite. On the same day, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that assisting in a suicide, while not specifically prohibited by statute, was a common-law felony and that there was no protected right to suicide assistance under the state constitution. This ruling reinstated cases against Kevorkian.

 Kevorkian opened a Medicide clinic in Springfield Township, Michigan, in June 1995. He named the clinic after his sister Margaret, who had died in 1994. Kevorkian referred to physician-assisted suicide by euthanasia as ""Medicide"" and to the people he assisted with such as his ""consulting patients"" or ""Medicide patients."" He reasoned that his role was of a ""consulting doctor"" because he did not provide treatment as would a traditional doctor--by helping patients overcome or control a disease in order to live. The first and only Medicide clinic patient was a 60-year-old Kansas City, Missouri, woman with ALS, Erika Garcellano. A few days later the clinic was evicted by the building's owner.

 The second trial of Dr. Kevorkian began on February 20, 1996 in Pontiac, Michigan. Kevorkian was charged in the deaths of Merian Frederick and Dr. Ali Khalili, 61, of Oak Brook, Illinois, who suffered from bone cancer and who died in November 1993. Both deaths occurred in Kevorkian's apartment. The trial was assigned to Judge David Breck, Thompson led the prosecution, and Fieger led the defense team. Thompson argued that Kevorkian had acted recklessly and failed to discuss other options with the deceased's family physicians. Frederick and Khalil family members testified for the defense by expressing their appreciation that Kevorkian ended the suffering experienced by their loved ones. The jury acquitted Kevorkian on March 8, 1996. In 1997, a group calling themselves Merian's Friends formed with the intention of placing the issue of physician-assisted suicide on the ballot in hopes of legalizing the practice.

 The third trial began almost immediately after Kevorkian's second acquittal, on April 16, 1996. He was charged in assisting in the deaths of Marjorie Wantz and Sherry Miller in 1991. The prosecution challenged Kevorkian's subjective judgment in determining whether Marjorie Wantz was mentally competent to make the decision to end her own life, as three psychiatrists had diagnosed Wantz as mentally ill and recommended that she receive counseling. Kevorkian faced a maximum of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine if convicted in the Wantz and Miller deaths. For the start of the trial, Kevorkian wore colonial costume--tights, a white powdered wig, and big buckle shoes--meant to protest the fact that he was being tried under centuries-old common law. Once again, defense presented family testimonies. He was acquitted by the jury on May 14, 1996.

 During the trials, Kevorkian received support from the professional medical community. In October 1995 a group of doctors and other medical experts in Michigan announced its support of Kevorkian, saying they would draw up a set of guiding principles for the ""merciful, dignified, medically-assisted termination of life."" In February 1996, the <title render=""italic"">New England Journal of Medicine</title> published results of a massive study of physicians' attitudes towards doctor-assisted suicide in Oregon and Michigan. The study demonstrated that a large number of the physicians surveyed supported doctor-assisted suicide under some conditions. Oregon was the first state to legalize assisted suicide when voters passed a tightly restricted Death with Dignity Act in October 1994. Oregon enacted the Death with Dignity Act in October 27, 1997, allowing terminally-ill Oregonians to end their lives through the voluntary self-administration of lethal medications, expressly prescribed by a physician for that purpose.

 Ionia County Circuit Judge Charles Miel declared a mistrial in Dr. Kevorkian's fourth assisted suicide trial, in June 1997, only a day after it got under way. By the time of his fourth trial, Kevorkian admitted attending 45 Medicides since 1990.

 Between September and October of 1998, the Michigan legislature enacted a law making assisted suicide a felony punishable by a maximum five-year prison sentence or a $10,000 fine. They also closed the loophole that had allowed for Kevorkian's previous acquittals. On November 22, 1998, CBS's show, <title render=""italic"">60 Minutes,</title> aired a September 17, 1998, video recording of the lethal injection administered to Thomas Youk, 52, an ALS patient who had requested Kevorkian's help. On the recording, Kevorkian helped Youk to administer the drugs, which was significant in that all of his earlier Medicide patients had reportedly completed the process themselves. Kevorkian allowed the tape to be aired and spoke to<title render=""italic""> 60 Minutes</title>, daring the courts to pursue him legally. Following this program, a second-degree murder charge against Kevorkian was filed. This time Kevorkian chose to represent himself in court.

 On March 26, 1999, a jury in Oakland County, Michigan, convicted Kevorkian of second-degree murder and the illegal delivery of a controlled substance. In April, Judge Jessica R. Cooper sentenced him to 10-25 years in prison with the possibility of parole. During the next three years, Kevorkian unsuccessfully attempted to pursue the conviction in appeals court. Lawyers representing Kevorkian sought to bring the case before the U.S. Supreme Court, but that request was also declined.

 While in prison, Kevorkian continued to write. He prepared essays that accompanied art, music, photographs, books, and poetry, to be included in the exhibit, ""The Doctor Is In: The Art of Dr. Jack Kevorkian,"" which opened in September 1999 at the Armenian Library and Museum of America in Watertown, Massachusetts. In April 2000 he received the Gleitsman Citizen Activist of the Year Award and a sculpture designed by Maya Lin, creator of the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, D.C. In 2002 Kevorkian participated, through written questions, in a program on death and dying at Oklahoma City University. Also in 2002 Dr. Kevorkian was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. In August 2003 he was called to give deposition, as an expert witness on medical research on the effect of mercury on human tissue, based on his early writings on the subject. He prepared articles for <title render=""italic"">The New York Times</title>, the William Safire column, ""On Language,"" <title render=""italic"">Forbes ASAP</title>, <title render=""italic"">Popular Mechanics</title>, <title render=""italic"">New York Review of Books</title>, <title render=""italic"">The Nation</title>, and<title render=""italic""> American Journal of Forensics Psychiatry</title>, among others. Kevorkian wrote the books <title render=""italic"">glimmerIQs</title> (2004)--an anthology on previous research and new material on philosophy, medicine, mathematics, religion, history, health, medicine, art, humor, his life, and the future; <title render=""italic"">Amendment IX: Our Cornucopia of Rights</title> (2005)--a book on the subject of the U.S. Bill of Rights; and in 2007 Kevorkian started working on <title render=""italic"">Dear Dr. Jack,</title> using selected letters out of the thousands written to him by supporters during his incarceration.

 After eight years in prison, on June 1, 2007, Kevorkian was paroled for good behavior and released from the Lakeland Correctional Facility. He was on parole for two years, under the conditions that he not assist anyone else in dying or provide care for anyone older than 62 or disabled. He was also forbidden by the rules of his parole from commenting about assisted suicide. Kevorkian said he would abstain from assisting any more terminal patients with Medicide and that he would restrict his role to persuading states to change their laws on assisted suicide.

 As Kevorkian was suffering from liver damage due to his advanced stages of Hepatitis C, doctors suspected he had little time left to live. However, in 2008, at the age of 79, Kevorkian decided to run as an Independent candidate for the U.S. Congress, against Republican Joe Knollenberg and Democrat Gary Peters. Also in 2008, he began working on his book, <title render=""italic"">When the People Bubble Pops</title> , about the dangers of overpopulation around the world. In 2009 Kevorkian lectured to more than 5,000 students--at the University of Florida, Wayne State University, and other colleges. The following year Kevorkian wrote on the subject of the Ninth Amendment in the form of a Bill of Rights of Natural Rights, prepared another anthology of his early research for World Press, and spoke to the Armenian Association at UCLA.

 In 2010 Kevorkian attempted to travel to Armenia but was not allowed on the plane from Berlin, Germany. Also that year he met with the executive team of the HBO film, <title render=""italic"">You Don't Know Jack.</title> Production had begun in 2005, while Kevorkian was still imprisoned. The film is based in part on the book, <title render=""italic"">Between the Dying and the Dead: Dr. Jack Kevorkian's Life and the Battle to Legalize Euthanasia</title> by Neal Nicol and Harry Wylie (University of Wisconsin Press, 2006). The film featured Al Pacino as Jack Kevorkian, Brenda Vaccaro as Margaret Janus, Susan Sarandon as Janet Good (a longtime civil rights worker who cooperated with Kevorkian), Danny Huston as Geoffrey Fieger, and John Goodman as Neal Nicol. The film was released later in 2010 and was nominated for 16 Emmys. Kevorkian attended the 2010 Emmy Awards in Los Angeles, where Al Pacino asked him to ""stand before the world."" In addition to<title render=""italic""> You Don't Know Jack</title>, he was the subject of the documentaries <title render=""italic"">Right to Exit</title> (2004) and <title render=""italic"">Kevorkian</title> (2010).

 Kevorkian's art has received critical acclaim. Many of his paintings created after 1993 are preserved in a permanent collection of Dr. Jack Kevorkian's materials at the Armenian Library and Museum of America in Watertown, Massachusetts. Kevorkian referred to his paintings as social, political, and medical commentaries that should provoke thought and discussion on aspects of life that may be disagreeable but are universal. Several of the paintings are part of a series on medical signs and symptoms, in which Kevorkian shows the conditions of human suffering that he witnessed on a daily basis.

 His musical art depicts the lighter side of mankind. An active musician and composer, he played and composed pieces for flute, organ, piano, and keyboard. His personal idol was Johann Sebastian Bach, whose works were played in Kevorkian's hospital room before he died. Kevorkian's own musical compositions are strongly influenced by Bach, and some of his 1999 paintings are celebrations of Bach's music.

 In 2010 Kevorkian's website, The Kevorkian Papers, was launched www.thekevorkianpapers.com.

 Dr. Jack Kevorkian died on Friday, June 3, 2011, at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan. With him were his niece, Ava Janus, and his attorney and friend, Mayer Morganroth.

Both chairs were funded the Alex and Marie Manoogian Foundation.

 The Armenian Studies Program features a vigorous outreach program to involve Armenians of Southeastern Michigan and the Midwest in its educational activities, periodic lectures, and films. The program publishes a yearly newsletter, develops cultural programs and the Summer Language Institute, an intensive six-week course on Armenian language held at Yerevan State University in Armenia. Courses focus on Armenian language, history, architecture, literature, and intellectual history. The Armenian Studies Program is affiliated with the International Institute and involves faculty from several different departments, centers, and programs across campus.

The Workshop was conceived of and planned by University of Michigan professors Fatma Müge Göçek, Stephanie Platz, Kenneth Church, Kevork Bardakjian and Ronald Suny. In later years the organizing committee consisted of University of Michigan professors Müge Göçek, Suny, and Gerard Libaridian. The three transferred leadership of the Workshop to a new team of scholars in 2011.

 Between 2000 and 2011, members of the Workshop met eight times in the United States and Europe to discuss, present papers, and establish a shared historical record and rough consensus on interpretation of the tragedies of the last years of the Ottoman Empire. The University of Michigan hosted the second workshop in 2002, and in 2011 the Armenian Studies Program co-sponsored the eighth workshop in Amsterdam.

 The Middle East Studies Association recognized Drs. Müge Göçek and Suny and the scholars of the Workshop with the bestowing of the 2005 Academic Freedom Award, applauding their collective effort to ""initiate and implement a project that overcame political divisions in society and in the academy,"" and noting that the Workshop ""has provided a model that others addressing other conflicted histories can use in the years ahead.""[1]

 In 2011, a selection of the papers from the first seven workshops was published by Oxford University Press with the title <title render=""italic"">A Question of Genocide: Armenians and Turks at the End of the Ottoman Empire</title>.

The strength of the collection lies in its documentation of the history of the Stewart and Seymour families, especially the family correspondence from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.","The Stewart, Van Akin, and Seymour families were among the earliest settlers to Shiawassee County Michigan in the 1830s. James Van Akin (1794-1848) and his wife Elizabeth Jennings Van Akin moved to there from New York state in 1834. He and Elizabeth were farmers. They had eleven children, among them Henry Jennings Van Akin (1823-1896) who married Anne Stewart (1842-1884), also of Shiawassee County, Michigan.

 Anne was the daughter of Addison Stewart (1811-1848) and his wife Lucy Tilden Stewart (1811-1898) who came to Michigan in 1833 from Avon, New York. Their other children included sons Charles (1839-1864) and Damon (1834-1867), who both served in the American Civil War, and daughters Harriett (Hattie) (b. 1836) and Laura (b. 1838). Damon served in the 23rd Michigan, company F and William served in Michigan's 23rd regiment, company C. Laura married Henry Seymour (d. 1899).

 The Seymour family came to Michigan in the late 1830s when James Seymour relocated from Rochester, NY to Shiawassee County. Laura Stewart married his son Henry Seymour in the second half of the nineteenth century and they had five children. Their son James (b. 1864) married Elizabeth Graves Gilmore (1871-1947) and had a daughter Elizabeth Harriet Graves (1904-1970). Mary Seymour (1876-1964) was James's daughter from a previous marriage. Their daughter Hattie lived in Harpoot, Turkey in the late nineteenth century where she served as a missionary to the Armenians.

The materials document, somewhat unevenly, the efforts of the YMCA to tend to the spiritual, physical, and social needs of the young men in Detroit. The strengths of this record group are in its minutes (Secretary's records) and photographs, each of which provides detailed and telling insight into the development of Detroit and the YMCA from the nineteenth century to 2006. The scrapbooks created by the YMCA, 1936-1973, are also of interest in that they accurately reflect all newspaper coverage of YMCA events and activities for this decade.

 The records have been arranged in four series: Administration, Secretary's Records, Visual Materials, and Scrapbooks.","The Metropolitan Offices of the YMCA of Metropolitan Detroit were established in 1921 to oversee the operations of the various YMCA branches in Detroit and to serve as liaison between these branches and the state and national offices of the YMCA. Until the formal establishment of these offices these tasks were executed by the officers of the downtown branch of the Detroit YMCA. The Detroit YMCA traces its origins to efforts made in 1852 and 1858 to organize those interested in improving ""the spiritual and mental condition of young men."" Neither of these efforts were sustained. After the Civil War, in the midst of a national resurgence of the YMCA, the Detroit YMCA was re-established in 1867 with a mission expanded to include physical and social elements of man's existence. This version of the Detroit YMCA was able to sustain and expand its efforts in the community by building new facilities, increasing membership, raising its profile locally, and expanding its programs.

 With a membership of nearly one thousand, and no access to a suitable building, the Detroit YMCA underwrote the building of the city's first YMCA building in 1887. This structure at Griswold and Grand River contained reading rooms, a library, a plunge, and a gymnasium. It adequately served the needs of local members for nearly twenty years. At the same time, the needs of railroad workers passing through Detroit were met at the ""Railroad Y"" on the south side of town. As Detroit's population grew, the demand for and use of the YMCA facilities outstripped the existing plant. In May 1906, with membership breaching three thousand, the Detroit YMCA raised over $500,000 to erect a new building. In 1909, the new Downtown YMCA opened at the corner of Witherell and Adams. This building contained reading rooms, a library, two gymnasiums (one for men and one for boys), a swimming pool, five floors of residence rooms, handball courts, and administrative office space.

 From 1910 to 1930 the population of Detroit trebled. The growth in YMCA membership more than matched the city's rapid population growth, moving from just under four thousand in 1910 to fourteen thousand in 1930. It was immediately clear that the Downtown YMCA building would be unable to provide convenient access to its facilities to all interested men. The answer lay in the opening of six neighborhood branches of the YMCA between 1916 and 1924: Highland Park, Western, Fisher, St. Antoine, Mack Avenue, and Hannan. The formation of these branches precipitated the formal creation of the Metropolitan Offices of the Detroit YMCA to handle business which had formerly been dealt with by the downtown branch officers. A five million dollar fund raising drive was held in May 1925 in order to finance the building of facilities for each of the branches. The success of this drive was assured by the generosity of several prominent Detroit families, among them the Fords, Dodges, Kresges, Fishers, and Hannans, who readily underwrote efforts to expand YMCA influence.

 The 1930s were grim and difficult times for both the city of Detroit and the YMCA. The shattered local economy could not sustain the growth of the YMCA generated by the boom times of the 1920s. Retrenchment led to the closing of the Hamtramck branch which had opened in 1928 and forced the curtailing of staff and operations in all branches. It was not until World War II that the Detroit YMCA recovered the momentum for growth which it enjoyed in the 1920s. This time the nexus of development was suburban Detroit as the YMCA continued to build in regions of population growth. The Wyandotte, Birmingham, Royal Oak, Dearborn, and Northwest YMCA buildings were all completed between 1944 and 1950. Membership in metropolitan YMCAs topped thirty thousand by 1950; the future looked rosy. Unfortunately for the St. Antoine branch, the growth and prosperity of the suburban branches did not guarantee the continued existence of the inner city branch reserved for Blacks. Given the changing social climate regarding segregated facilities, the reshaping of inner cities by urban renewal and highways, and the economic difficulties of St. Antoine, the Metropolitan Detroit YMCA opted to close this branch in 1960. Wayne-Westland branch was established in the early 1960s, experienced two building campaigns but closed in 2003.

 The YMCA is more than the sum of expanding membership and new buildings; its commitment to improving the mental, spiritual, social, and physical aspects of men is manifested through its programs. While many of these programs changed over time, the spiritual development of members remained a central feature at the core of the religious department of the YMCA. The mental condition of young men was tended to through lectures during the nineteenth century and through formal programs and institutions, especially the Detroit Institute of Technology, in the twentieth century. The social development of boys and young men was attended to by departments within the YMCA created to assure the inculcation of Christian ideals at an early age. Summer camps at Camp Nissokone (on Van Etten Lake near Oscoda) and Camp Ohiyesa (on Fish Lake near Clyde) were founded in the 1910s to further YMCA ideals in the great outdoors. The physical development was encouraged not only through the well appointed buildings, but through programs of physical education and the formation of leagues. In practice the spiritual, mental, social, and physical aspects of man were closely linked so that programs developed by the YMCA affected all four attributes.",5968; 10963; 6611; 10964; 5816; 6104; 5609; 3609; 4256; 5250; 4369; 3582; 4130; 5610; 3625; 10965; 4399; 4582; 3589; 3689; 4885; 5769; 6611; 4897,"African Americans; Physical fitness.; Young Men's Christian Associations.; Youth; African Americans; Americanization.; Banjos.; Basketball.; Broadcasting.; Buildings; Camps; Children.; Clubhouses.; Immigrants.; Laborers.; Maltese Americans; Minstrel shows.; Physical fitness.; Recreation.; Swimming.; Table tennis.; World War, 1914-1918.; Young Men's Christian Associations.; Youth",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm,3191; 3142; 3140,Digital file formats.; Photographs.; Scrapbooks.,aat; aat; aat,934; 751; 300; 752; 239; 753; 754; 755,Detroit (Mich.); Auburn Hills (Mich.); Birmingham (Mich.); Dearborn (Mich.); Detroit (Mich.); Eastpointe (Mich.); Highland Park (Mich.); Royal Oak (Mich.),lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm,,,,1749; 1028; 1749,YMCA of Metropolitan Detroit.

Includes correspondence, lectures and lecture notes, addresses and articles, subject files and personal materials, and photographs.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The Angell papers documents Angell's academic and diplomatic career. There is extensive material on all phases of University of Michigan business, particularly Angell's contacts with the state legislature, the board of regents, faculty relations, and the various schools, colleges, departments and divisions. Much of the correspondence and the Angell diaries relate to his diplomatic missions, higher education in the United States, and family matters.","James B. Angell was a college president and diplomat. Born in Scituate, Rhode Island on January 7, 1829, Angell was a graduate of Brown University, class of 1849. After a period of travel and study, he joined the faculty of Brown soon after receiving his A.M. in 1853 as professor of modern languages. Angell married Sarah Caswell in 1855, daughter of Brown faculty and future president, Alexis Caswell.  He resigned in 1860 to assume the editorship of the Providence Journal, a newspaper he had been writing for since 1858. As editor, Angell was especially interested in topics relating to international law and politics.

 In 1866, Angell resigned to accept the presidency of the University of Vermont. In 1869, he was offered the presidency of the University of Michigan. After initially refusing the offer, Angell, after more than a year of negotiation with the regents, accepted the offer to come to Ann Arbor on February 7, 1871. He would remain as president until his retirement in 1909.

 Because of his expertise in international affairs, Angell was called upon for occasional diplomatic service. He was minister to China from 1880 to 1881 and a member of a commission of three to negotiate a new immigration treaty which limited but did not absolutely prohibit the entry and residence of Chinese laborers into the United States. Angell remained in China until October 1881 and resumed his academic duties in February 1882.

 In 1887, President Grover Cleveland selected Angell to serve on the Anglo-American International Commission on Canadian Fisheries. Later in Cleveland's second administration, Angell was named chairman of the Canadian-American Commission on Deep Waterways from Lakes to Sea. Angell's last diplomatic venture was as U.S. Minister to Turkey, serving from 1897 to 1898.

 Angell died April 1, 1916.",3659; 3643; 3645; 3591; 17446,Funeral rites and ceremonies.; Interiors; Offices; Women; Women's resources,lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; local,3471; 3152; 3142; 3472; 3191,Albums.; Diaries.; Photographs.; Prints.; Digital file formats.,gmgpc; aat; aat; gmgpc; aat,861; 931; 932; 933,Ann Arbor (Mich.); China; Turkey.; Waterman Gymnasium (University of Michigan),lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,2789; 2789; 2789; 572; 1586; 4324; 870; 7785; 5045; 1597; 52; 572; 5200; 4956; 2194; 5993; 8894; 7892; 2791; 5225; 3323; 8530; 8991; 4017; 5572; 2721; 4262; 6417; 8875; 6028; 1696; 6648; 8034; 8892; 6670; 3560; 2600; 2594; 3295; 7404; 4589; 1200; 2538; 8452; 5018; 2421; 5945; 2197; 6546; 2374; 6828; 4162; 3115; 1586; 1932; 4617; 625; 442; 3287; 1208; 996; 2579; 2682; 3899; 2096; 2244; 8340; 4933; 1689; 5751; 2738; 4247; 5219; 5123; 8020; 8646; 8197; 261; 878; 2970; 1171; 8278; 2717; 4757; 101; 5930,"Angell, James Burrill, 1829-1916; Angell, James Burrill, 1829-1916; Angell, James Burrill, 1829-1916; Angell, Sarah Caswell, 1831-1903; Hutchins, Harry B.

843,umich-bhl-0434,"John Engler Papers, 1968-2003","Republican member of the Michigan state legislature (House and Senate, 1971-1990); governor of Michigan (1991-2003); active member of the Republican Governors' Association and the National Governors' Association. The Engler collection consists primarily of materials created and maintained by Governor Engler and his staff during the period when he was governor, 1991-2003. Other records include papers from his several terms in the Michigan House and the Michigan Senate. The collection includes papers files, photographs, sound recordings, videotapes, memorabilia, and some electronic files. The gubernatorial files are arranged mainly by unit or functional responsibility within the governor's office. These series are Executive Office, Communications Division, Legal Division, State Government Affairs, Legislative Affairs Division, Operations Division, External Affairs, Scheduling, Washington DC Office, and Office of the First Lady. Topics extensively documented include state welfare and school funding reform, reorganization of state boards and commissions, notably the restructuring of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, and Republican party politics.",The finding aid is written in English,"The John Engler papers are the most important source available for the study of Michigan's state government from 1991 to 2002. The collection is particularly strong on the topics of welfare and school funding reform, state government reorganization and the rising impact of the National Governors' Association in state and national politics. Engler's efforts to attract commerce to Michigan are also well-documented. The materials are arranged into two main subgroups: Pre-gubernatorial Papers and Gubernatorial Papers. The bulk of the material relates to Engler's gubernatorial career, therefore, the analysis that follows focuses primarily on this subgroup.

 The materials in the ""Gubernatorial Papers"" subgroup are arranged according to the offices and subdivisions of the governor's office that created them. This means that the governor's speeches and press releases, for example, may be found within a grouping or ""series"" called ""Communications Division,"" within the ""Gubernatorial"" subgroup, while legislative histories for various public acts may be found within the ""Legislative Affairs"" series.

 While some kinds of documents were produced uniquely by one division, other kinds were produced in several divisions of the governor's office. The governor's correspondence, for example, was drafted and approved by several different staff members. Letters to important business and political leaders may be found within the ""Executive Office"" series, the ""State Government Affairs"" series, and the ""Washington DC Office"" series in particular. There no comprehensive chronological correspondence file.

 In using the collection, the researcher should think functionally and ask who would have created the information sought. For example, the policy advisors in the State Government Affairs Division created individual topical files which gathered together correspondence and research materials to support briefing memoranda which they presented to the governor, while the speechwriters in the Communications Division often gathered different types of materials to help them shape the presentation of the same policies to the public.","When John Engler became Michigan's governor in 1991, he brought with him a classically conservative vision of a smaller, more efficient government, and of a state where taxes were lower, individual initiative was rewarded and business and opportunity could thrive. As Michigan's governor during the boom years of the 1990's, Engler led the state during a period of uncommon prosperity between 1991 and 2002. At the beginning of his tenure, however, Michigan's economy was less than ideal.

 After defeating incumbent James Blanchard in 1990 in an upset election, Engler inherited a $1.8 billion deficit. He embarked on an effort to cut spending and taxes, and reorganized the government. His first term spending cuts were painful and controversial, and included cuts in welfare for childless adults, state mental-health facilities, and arts programs. In the aftermath, Engler was widely viewed as a cold-hearted bureaucrat who was more concerned with balancing budgets than with the pain and suffering of poor people. But as it turned out, Michigan was on the vanguard of a national movement to change welfare, putting more focus on work. By the time Engler sought re-election in 1994, none of the three Democrats seeking the nomination proposed a return to the General Assistance Program.

 In his effort to achieve greater efficiency in state government, Engler presided over the most dramatic restructuring of state government in a generation. He eliminated entire departments and abolished dozens of boards and commissions. He pushed the power of the Executive Branch to the fullest extent permitted by the Michigan Constitution to implement his reorganizations.

 In 1995 Engler split the Michigan Department of Natural Resources into a parks and recreation-oriented DNR, and a new Department of Environmental Quality, charged with monitoring pollution and public health. The changes were controversial because critics claimed they interfered with citizen oversight.

 He also created the Michigan Jobs Commission and later, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. With an aggressive business attraction strategy and a locally driven job training system, Michigan managed to attract many new job-creating businesses. In fact, Michigan earned the prestigious ""Governor's Cup"" -- representing the nation's number one state for new factories and expansion projects -- a record-setting four years in a row (1997-2000).

 But education reform was Engler's top priority. He led the campaign to win citizen approval for Proposal A -- a 1994 ballot initiative that radically changed the way Michigan's public schools are funded. By loosening the connection between local property taxes and school funding, he aimed to make per-student funding more fair. And even though Proposal A slashed homeowners local property school tax rates by an average of 45%, school spending grew during Engler's tenure, from about $8 billion annually to nearly $12 billion--benefiting from booming tax revenues during the bountiful 1990's.

 Engler also championed school choice, charter schools and more competition as part of his plan to help Michigan schools improve. His administration focused on high standards, more accountability, tough tests, improved safety and more discipline to help Michigan's students learn better.

 Engler also saw the power of technology to create jobs and better people's lives. As the first governor to have a website, he pushed for increased availability of high-speed broadband Internet, and supported the creation of the nation's first on-line cybercourts. He also introduced a program to distribute laptop computers to more than 88,000 K-12 teachers statewide.

 Engler was Chairman of the Republican Governors' Association in 1996 and of the National Governor's Association July 2001 to July 2002. He was a member of the Advisory Board of the Republican National Leadership Council and was considered a top-seeded candidate for Bob Dole's Vice Presidential running-mate in 1996.

 John Engler was born October 12, 1948, the oldest of Mathias and Agnes Engler's seven children. His parents raised cattle on 900 acres near Beal City, Michigan and John majored in agricultural economics at Michigan State University. As a class project for a political science class, Engler wrote a paper outlining his strategy for winning a Republican primary against an incumbent for a seat in the state legislature. In 1970, before graduating, he enlisted the help of his friend, sophomore Dick Posthumus, and put his plan into action. He won the primary, and the general election to become, at age 22, the youngest Michigan legislator. Indeed, in his thirty-year political career, John Engler never lost an election.

 The Republicans were the minority party in the Michigan House when Engler set out in 1971, although Republican William Milliken controlled the governor's office. Engler served eight years in the House and twelve years in the Michigan Senate, rising to become Senate Majority Leader in 1984 after leading an intense effort to tip the balance toward the GOP. While serving in the legislature, Engler attended law school part-time and received his degree from Thomas Cooley Law School in 1981.

 He married fellow lawmaker Colleen House in 1975, though they divorced in 1986. He wed again to attorney Michelle DeMunbrun in 1990. They are the parents of triplet daughters, Margaret, Hannah and Madeleine, born November 13, 1994, just days after his reelection to a second gubernatorial term.",6248; 7488; 6688; 7489; 5987; 7490; 3873; 3875; 3849,Conservation of natural resources; Educational change; Environmental protection; Family policy; Governors; Public welfare administration; Governors; Political elections; Politics and government,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm,3191; 3142; 3144; 3141,Digital file formats.; Photographs.; Sound recordings.; Videotapes.,aat; aat; aat; aat,911; 818; 819; 1774; 1774,Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Michigan,lcsh; local; local; lcsh; lcsh,4448; 4448; 4448; 4448; 3291,"Engler, John, 1948-; Engler, John, 1948-; Engler, John, 1948-; Engler, John, 1948-; Engler, Michelle.",lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf,11; 4319; 725; 4636; 4077; 4077; 11; 4077,Michigan.

 The Lacy Family papers are rich in detail about life in Michigan in the nineteenth and early twentieth century; the surviving letters document family crises and Lacy's role in them as the oldest and most successful child and later, as family leader. Lacy was the family genealogist and he collected and preserved the family correspondence of his uncles and aunt, some of which date back to the 1850's.","Arthur J. Lacy was born September 30,1876 in Nirvana, a lumbering town in Lake County, Michigan. His family was large and exceptionally close and from an early age, as the oldest living child, he participated in the family businesses. He attended school until he was twelve, but received most of his literary education at home. As a teenager he passed Michigan's school teachers' examination and taught in a one room school for a year. In 1894, he went to seek a law degree at Northern Indiana Normal School at Valparaiso, Indiana (now Valparaiso University), and in two years was admitted to the Indiana bar although he was underage. In 1896, he began the study of law at the University of Michigan which he completed in 1898. In 1899, he and his wife Beth Garwick Lacy settled in Clare, Michigan, where he set up his law practice.

 In 1902, he was elected to his first of four terms as mayor. Retiring from that office in 1906, he later sought the office of prosecuting attorney, for which he was defeated. In 1909, he accepted an invitation from Alfred Lucking, Henry Ford's lawyer, to practice law in Detroit. Governor Woodbridge Ferris, with whom he had corresponded since childhood, appointed Lacy judge of the new Detroit Domestic Relations Court in 1913. Lacy under-took initial organization of the court, which had jurisdiction over divorce and family cases. The court was dissolved eight months later in 1914, by the Michigan Supreme Court and Lacy again entered private practice in the law firm of Anderson, Rackham, and Wilcox, replacing the retiring Horace Rackham.

 In 1920, he was appointed head of the Detroit Civil Service Commission by Mayor James Couzens, whose private attorney he was until Couzen's death. In 1923-1928, he represented Couzens in the Ford Stock Tax Case, and was instrumental in the settlement of the case in favor of the stockholders. Lacy also wrote for Couzens the instrument of Trust setting up the Children's Fund of Michigan. In 1930, Lacy began a personal campaign to reduce heavy taxes during the depression, which he thought could be done by decreasing the cost of government. In 1932 and 1933, he assisted thirty small Michigan banks in avoiding panic and remaining solvent. He was also deeply involved in the Detroit bank crisis of 1933 and co-author of the Michigan Emergency Banking Act. These public involvements catapulted him into prominence in the Democratic party.

 In 1934, Lacy was mentioned as a candidate for U.S. Senator. But only after great persuasion did he enter the Democratic gubernatorial primary to challenge successfully the current governor William A. Comstock. In the November election, he ran against Republican Frank Fitzgerald, but was defeated. Lacy's political decline was apparently rapid. He devoted his time to his legal practice and philanthropic activities that included the Salvation Army, the Boys' Club of Detroit, and the Youth Services of the Knights Templar, Grand Commandery of Detroit. He also began to diverge politically from Franklin D. Roosevelt, recoiling from deficit spending, the welfare state, attempted court packing, and Roosevelt's intention to run for a third term. Lacy, however, was never welcomed as a statesman in the Republican party.

 In 1947, Lacy retired from active participation in his law firm and cut back his legal work. He remained involved in income tax cases, a field in which he was considered an expert. Most of his public activities were connected with philanthropy, although he served on the National Sanitation Foundation and on the Board of Directors of the Parker Rust Proof Company. He died in 1975.",8805; 6557; 5787; 7304; 5675; 8806; 7810; 8807; 5999; 6262; 6263; 5741; 5809; 8808; 6499; 7343; 6492; 7083; 8040; 6556; 8809; 6247; 6266; 8810; 5953; 5863; 5769; 8811; 5738; 4403; 4616; 3685; 3626; 3801; 3579,"Arbitration, International.; Banks and banking; Civil rights; Civil service.; Cold war.; Constitutional law; Crime.; Debts, Public; Depressions; Elections; Elections; Immigrants; Jewish-Arab relations.; Judges; Juvenile delinquency; Labor unions; Lawyers; Municipal government; Oral history.; Prohibition; Sit-down strikes; Taxation; Temperance; Trusts, Industrial.; Women; Women's rights; World War, 1914-1918.; World War, 1914-1918; World War, 1939-1945.; Dwellings; Dwellings; Golf.; Lumber industry.; Schools; Women.",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; local; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm,3468; 3152; 3142; 3140; 3466,Cartoons.; Diaries.; Photographs.; Scrapbooks.; Tintypes.,gmgpc; aat; aat; aat; gmgpc,1803; 934; 1262; 1703; 864; 885; 911; 809; 810; 805; 814; 811; 2180; 945; 1254; 316; 2181; 370,Clare (Mich.); Detroit (Mich.); Hawaii.; Mexico; Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Nirvana (Mich.); Philippines; Wayne County (Mich.); Detroit (Mich.); Foxville (Mich.); Nirvana (Mich.),lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; local; local; local; local; local; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lcsh; lctgm,2755; 1888; 7653; 2755; 3890; 3506; 5779; 56; 8788; 8988; 8751; 2646; 8681; 978; 7694; 943; 4654; 6723; 7082; 3425; 5843; 362; 2929; 7366; 2346; 6150; 7897; 6675; 5790; 2384; 7775; 7421; 7404; 4794; 8153; 8935; 2105; 730; 6259; 2946; 4023; 6307; 7793; 3629; 5527; 6384; 7034; 4286; 5349; 1499; 8800; 2467; 2244; 5401; 504; 895; 8187; 8207; 2738; 6122; 2392; 5954; 4474; 2417; 6884; 3817; 4554; 63; 2855; 5273; 2943; 5003; 3690; 7363; 932; 2454; 4067; 6238; 669; 1419,"Lacy, Arthur J.

The program initially served as a hub for interdisciplinary courses. In the 1970s the program and coursework expanded to include the study of women and minority groups with an emphasis on Latino Studies as well as art and media studies. The Program became a Department in 2012. Records include administrative files, directors' correspondence, committee minutes, curriculum material, topical files, and material on faculty members and their activities.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The Department of American Culture (University of Michigan) records (5 linear feet, 12.36 GB and 1 archived website) contain administrative files, curriculum information, and faculty files. It also features materials documenting the interdisciplinary connections between the department and other schools, programs, and departments at the University of Michigan. The collection includes records from two of the Department of American Culture's ethnic studies programs, the Latino/a Studies Program and the Arab and Muslim American Studies Program. ","The Program in American Culture at the University of Michigan began in 1952 through the efforts of English professor Joe Lee Davis and interested students. An early history of the program cites the reason for creation as the desire to provide students with the ""opportunity to study American life from different points of view to get at the foundations of American culture."" Before the existence of a formal American culture program, graduate and undergraduate degrees in the American culture area were administered through independent study. In 1952, the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies and the College of Literature, Science and the Arts decreed that the discipline should be recognized as a formal department. Following that recommendation, Professor Davis was appointed as its first director and an Executive committee was created comprised of professors in other departments with American culture interests. At this time, the program depended upon the willingness of other department faculty members to participate in offering American Culture courses. Many professors who teach in the area are not solely appointed to the American Culture department, but also have joint appointments with other departments, such as English, History, or Women's Studies. The program achieved full departmental status in 2012. 

 Since the birth of the department, it’s philosophy has passed through several stages. In its early days the program revolved around the study of traditional American values and aspired to build bridges between the humanities and social sciences in order to gain a better understanding of these values. Since then however, the program has broadened its scope significantly and become a truly interdepartmental program. In the early 1970s, the program began to view itself as a facilitator for the study of all American cultures, not just the European-American culture. Taking into account America's ever-increasing diversity of national origins, races, religions, and social status, program coursework evolved to include in its curriculum the study of women, Asian American, African American, Hispanic American, Native American and other ethnic minority cultures.

 The new study of other cultures in the 1970s helped to attract new faculty and further expand the program's scope. In 1984 for example, the program developed a curricular program in Latino/a Studies to address the growing societal and student interest in the history and study of Hispanic culture in America. Students from Latino/a Studies sought out other Latin American area classes and faculty in departments such as romance languages, history, sociology, and anthropology, adding new classes and bringing new faculty members to American Culture.

 The original undergraduate curriculum consisted mainly of literature, history, and social studies courses, though students were permitted to select several courses from anthropology, economics, education, journalism, philosophy, political science, the fine arts, music, and speech. In 1970, the first core course, ""American Values,"" was created in an effort to attract concentrators, bring a more unified approach to undergraduate concentration, and provide teaching opportunities for the program's graduate students. Curriculum changes persisted throughout the 1970s. Four different undergraduate tracks were created in English, history, the social sciences, and fine arts. A comparative culture component was added to allow students to study other cultures in addition to American culture. These tracks were later expanded, and as of 1994, consisted of seven tracks: Arts and Media, British and American Studies, Minority Studies, Intellectual History and Literature, Society and Politics, Latino/a Studies, and Self-Designed.
 
	The University of Michigan Program in American Culture was renamed the Department of American Culture in 2012. In 2019, the Department of American Culture offered two majors in American Culture and Latina/o Studies. The department features four formal ethnic studies programs in Arab and Muslim American Studies, Asian/Pacific Islander Studies, Latina/o Studies, and Native American Studies. The Department of American Culture also has a strong focus on African American Studies and Digital Studies.

 Masters and Ph.D. programs originally existed in the Program in American Culture. Journalists and teachers were frequent recipients of the American Culture masters degree. However, the masters program gradually declined until in 1974, it was only ""reserved for unusual cases where it was inadvisable for students to continue into the Ph.D. program."" The Ph.D. program, on the other hand, strengthened over time especially with the demise of the masters program. The papers illustrate the growth of the doctoral program to be increasingly sensitive to the diversity of American Culture.

The records cover the center's history fairly evenly, but document the period from the 1970s to the 1990s in greater depth than the center's first decade. While the 1960s are documented in correspondence, funding reports, and press clippings, records from the later decade also include executive committee minutes, material from conferences and lectures, and photographs. The CMENAS records cover a variety of topics related to the history, politics, economy, literature and art of the Middle East. Furthermore, the records document how American universities studied those topics from the 1940s to the 1990s.

 The records are arranged in twelve series: Area Centers Material, Executive Committee, Evaluation, Funding, Historical Material, Intra-University Programs, Name File, National Organizations, Outreach, Publications Related Files, Special Activities, and Photographs.","The Center for Middle Eastern and North African Studies (CMENAS) was created by the University of Michigan in 1961. It was originally called the Center for Near and Middle Eastern Studies, which was changed to the Center for Near Eastern and North African Studies in 1963, and was changed once again in 1991 to its current name. The Center was one of many ""area centers"" established at American universities in the post-World War II era. Following the war, American foreign policy makers argued that a lack of American expertise in foreign language and culture had hindered the U.S. war effort, and that this deficiency would continue to weaken the nation's global position. Area centers were intended to remedy this weakness by encouraging intense interdisciplinary scholarship with a strong focus on the mastery of language. In 1947, the University of Michigan established its first area studies center, the Center for Japanese Studies.

 The Center for Middle Eastern and North African Studies was the product of an expansion of area studies at the university proposed by the College of Literature, Science and the Arts (LS&amp;A) in 1959. LS&amp;A appointed a committee chaired by anthropology professor William Schorger to develop the proposal. The committee recommended the creation of four new centers: the Center for Chinese Studies, the Center for Russian and Eastern European Studies, the Center for South and Southeast Asian Studies, and the Center for Near and Middle Eastern Studies. In 1961, the university secured a large grant from the Ford Foundation to carry out the proposal, and launched the new centers. Schorger was appointed director of the Center for Near and Middle Eastern Studies.

 The new center drew upon the faculty of a variety of academic departments. Professors from the extant Department of Near Eastern Studies, who were mostly language experts, provided the core of the center's faculty; they were joined by faculty from history, anthropology, economics, the history of art, and other disciplines whose work concerned the Middle East or North Africa.

 The center's main objectives are to coordinate research on the Middle East and North Africa and to train experts on those regions. In its first decade, the center primarily fulfilled these goals by funding faculty instruction and research, providing fellowships to students, and supporting library acquisitions. In the 1970s and 1980s, the center expanded its activities by hosting academic conferences, sponsoring lectures, and developing workshops on the Middle East for secondary school instructors. In the 1990s, the Center has continued its varied activities, supported by federal grants under the Title VI National Resource Center and Foreign Language Fellowships Program.",6924; 6925; 6924,"Middle East; Persian Gulf War, 1991; Middle East",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,3142,Photographs.,aat,,,,1653; 1653; 7451; 7519; 170; 723; 5868; 5651; 5316; 7385,"Mitchell, Richard P.

 The primary purpose of the organization was to empower women to work towards the elimination of nuclear weapons and to educate themselves and the general public about the dangers of continued weapons production.

The material predominantly covers the mid-1960s until Mazrui's departure from the University of Michigan in 1989. Also included in the collection is various material related to the television series ""The Africans: A Triple Heritage"". ","Ali Al'Amin Mazrui (مزروعي، علي الأمين) was born on February 24, 1933, in Mombasa, Kenya. He received a B.A. from the University of Manchester, England, in 1960, an M.A. from Columbia University in 1961, and a D.Phil. from Oxford University in 1966. His thesis was titled ""The idea of self-government and the idiom of nationalism in some Commonwealth African countries, 1957-1963"". 

 Mazrui began his academic career in 1966 at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, where he became head of the Department of Political Science and Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences. In 1973, Mazrui was forced to leave Uganda by President Idi Amin, and joined the faculty of the University of Michigan in 1974 as a professor of political science. He was affiliated with the university's Center for Afroamerican and African Studies (CAAS) and served as director of the center from 1978 to 1981.

 In 1989, Mazrui departed from the University of Michigan for the State University of New York at Binghamton, becoming the Albert Schweitzer Professor in the Humanities and director of the Institute of Global Cultural Studies. Mazrui left Michigan after a widely reported bidding war that ultimately resulted in a lucrative compensation package for the scholar. Mazrui commented at the time that, in addition to the $500,000 SUNY offer, he left Michigan because he was not satisfied with the university's ""commitment to Third World studies.""

 A prolific author, Mazrui wrote or edited more than twenty books and hundreds of scholarly and popular articles. He was a visiting scholar at many institutions, including Cornell University, the University of Papua New Guinea, Harvard University, and the University of Nairobi. He was generally considered to be an leading scholar in the field of African studies and a major African public intellectual, and was the subject of numerous articles and books. In addition to academic positions, Mazrui served as officer of several scholarly associations in his field, as consultant to the World Bank, the United Nations, and other international organizations, and as a member of the board of the American Muslim Council.[1]

 Mazrui wrote on numerous topics, including nationality, ethnic conflict, and religion. He suggested that African cultures are affected by three important influences -- Islam, the West, and its own native tradition -- which he terms Africa's ""triple heritage."" Identifying himself at different times at different points on the ideological spectrum, but generally left of center, Mazrui was critical of the power wielded by Western countries over Africa and previously colonized nations in the Global South. A Muslim, Mazrui's religion was also a frequent theme of his work, and he was critical of Israel's position in the Middle East, and of Western support for Israel. Mazrui was also highly critical of Salman Rushdie's 1988 novel The Satanic Verses. 

 Outside of the academic world, Mazrui received the most attention for his work as writer and host of a 1986 documentary television series produced jointly by the BBC and PBS entitled ""The Africans."" Although partially funded by the US government through the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the nine-part program was harshly criticized after its presentation in the United States by NEH chair Lynne Cheney for what she described as its anti-Western politics.[2]

 Mazrui was married twice and is the father of five sons. He passed away peacefully of natural causes in his home in Vestal, New York on October 12, 2014. His body was repatriated to Mombasa and buried according to his wishes at the historical monument of Fort Jesus.
